__label__1@  This is carried proximally to expose the aortic bifurcation and the inferior mesenteric artery (IMA); it stops at the cephalad aspect of the left renal vein.
__label__2@  The most common indication is carcinoma of the right, left, or sigmoid colon. 
__label__1@  A separate Pfannenstiel, Gibson, or lower midline incision can be made if the specimen is substantially large.
__label__1@  Toward the apex, the neurovascular bundle can be gently teased off the prostate.
__label__2@  The skin incision is made in the midline, far enough away from the selected stoma site that the ostomy appliance will not interfere but close enough that a hand can be used to create the defect in the abdominal wall.
__label__1@  Additionally, it may identify any satellite tumor lesions and help in planning the surgical resection.
__label__1@  The anastomosis is completed, and the specimen is resected with a second transverse firing of the stapler.

__label__2@  When establishing surgical exposure, care must be taken not to inadvertently avulse the delicate adrenal vasculature, especially the right adrenal vein.
__label__1@  A temporary pelvic drain can then be inserted into the pelvis through one of the lateral port sites if desired.
__label__2@  Setup time in both multiport and singlesite approaches improves with familiarity with the instrumentation and docking; the operative time similarly also decreases.

__label__1@  A standard laparoscopic feeding jejunostomy is placed, and the abdominal phase is completed.
__label__1@  The sacral veins must be adequately cauterized at this location.
__label__2@  In general the mesh should be lightweight and porous. 
__label__1@  A transperitoneal approach is always favored to facilitate learning and reproducibility of the technique, which is a point of particular interest at an academic institution.
__label__1@  The port incision was made just below the 12th rib in the posterior axillary line.
__label__2@  However, division of the urethra too close to the prostate may lead to positive apical margins. 
__label__2@  Surgical residency training programs have begun integrating robotic surgical training into their curriculum, and the robotic multiport cholecystectomy is a useful procedure to introduce residents to the robotic platform.
__label__1@  The hepatic flexure is mobilized by first grasping the omentum with the third arm.
__label__1@  To inject dye at the 3–9 o’clock positions to allow adequate detection of SLNs without staining of the bladder flap.

__label__1@  For the left ureter, a small enterotomy is made sharply, adjacent to the proximal end of the conduit.
__label__1@  A suction irrigator can be replaced through either curved cannula.
__label__2@  There is little debate that the gold standard for resectional therapy of thymoma, with or without myasthenia gravis, is generally median sternotomy, with thoracoscopy advocated as an alternative for the treatment of known benign cystic diseases.
__label__1@  The Si da Vinci robot is positioned at the head of the patient.
__label__1@  Once again, the staplers are introduced from the utility incision keeping them above the underlying interlobar pulmonary artery.
__label__1@  The 12-mm assistant port is closed under direct vision or with a laparoscopic closure device.
__label__1@  Usually, the plane between the upper pole of the kidney and the ipsilateral adrenal gland is freed to help facilitate mobilization of the kidney and better identification of the renal hilum.
__label__1@  This space is then bluntly developed to mobilize the posterior vaginal wall off of the rectum.
__label__1@  Similar surgical technique and principles are applied to an LLND.
__label__1@  Retraction is then placed on the cut pedicle, and medial-tolateral mobilization of the right colon is performed.

__label__1@  The vasa deferentia and posterior seminal vesicles are then dissected free.
__label__1@  Throughout the dissection, cautery is utilized for meticulous hemostasis, and clips are used judiciously at both the proximal and distal limits to prevent lymphatic leakage.
__label__1@  One will be used for the posterior wall (furthest from the camera), and one will be used for the anterior wall (closest to the camera).
__label__1@  The robot may then be docked.
__label__1@  Lower the table, and position the instrument arms to avoid collisions with the patient and equipment.

__label__1@  The robotic fourth arm is then used to retract the bladder and prostate anteriorly to expose the posterior space.
__label__2@  Entry into the abdomen should be performed in a manner consistent with the surgeon’s preference and comfort level.
__label__1@  Their surrounding lymphatic tissue is carefully swept up toward the specimen, and then the vessels are divided at their origin with surgical clips or a linear stapler.
__label__2@  This maneuver will also aid in stent passage later in the case.
__label__2@  In our experience, the specimen may require extraction through the abdomen due to its large size in less than 5% of cases.
__label__1@  When operating with the da Vinci S system, a colorimetric dye must be used.
__label__1@  The open end of the Roux limb is closed with a linear stapler.

__label__1@  The donuts are sent to pathology for examination.
__label__1@  Initially a fenestrated bipolar grasper is placed in arm 2, arm 1 receives monopolar scissors or an energy sealant device, and grasping forceps are placed in arm 3.
__label__1@  The preferred instruments include curved bipolar Maryland forceps on the first arm and ultrasonic shears or a monopolar device and the Cadiere forceps, interchangeably, on the second and third arms.
__label__2@  Figure highlights the anatomic regions in both an LLND and ELND.
__label__2@  The establishment of abdominal access and safe facilitation of trocar placement is paramount to the application of minimally invasive surgery, including robotic multiport cholecystectomy. 
__label__1@  Under real-time US, the proposed line for tumor excision can be circumferentially scored on the renal capsule with the monopolar scissor around the tumor.
__label__1@  At this point, if a nerve-sparing procedure is performed, the prostatic fasciae are released high on the lateral prostate with sharp dissection.
__label__1@  A KOH cup or device that delineates the cervical/vaginal junction will then assist the surgeon as to how far the bladder needs to be mobilized.
__label__2@  The uterine manipulator should function in a way that the spaces anterior, posterior, and directly lateral to the uterus are easily visualized.
__label__1@  Remove the assistant trocar.
__label__1@  Under general anaesthesia with a double lumen intubation, the patient is placed in left lateral decubitus with the hips fixed at the level of the table break and flexed to achieve maximum separation of the intercostal spaces.
__label__1@  To minimize collision, the 25-mm multichannel robotic port is placed at the kidney-side end of the GelSeal cap, and the 12-mm port is placed at the opposite end.
__label__1@  Great care is taken to identify the airway early in this dissection and to carefully dissect free the subcarinal lymph nodes.
__label__1@  The stomach is now reflected into the left upper quadrant to allow for the D2 lymphadenectomy.
__label__1@  The omentum and bowel are retracted out of the field of view.
__label__1@  A 12-mm trocar should be used for trocar 1 to allow the use of the robotic stapler.
__label__2@  The indications have remained unchanged since the original NIH Consensus Development Conference Statement on Gallstones and Laparoscopic Cholecystectomy. 
__label__1@  The neurovascular bundle is then gently dissected away from the posterolateral surface of the prostate.
__label__2@  In total, 40 cm of bowel is isolated, and the urethral anastomosis is performed as described.
__label__2@  Visual cues and tissue feedback are important during dissection to provide assurance of the correct dissection plane.
__label__1@  This vaginal incision is then carried distally anterolaterally along each side of the vaginal wall using the robotic vessel sealer device.
__label__1@  Once the abdomen is entered, the needle driver holding the specimen bag is passed to the incision.
__label__1@  To improve access to the origin of the LGA from the celiac axis, divide the retroperitoneal attachments alongthe lesser curvature of the stomach, along the right diaphragmatic crux.
__label__2@  A high index of suspicion and immediate recognition of access injuries is crucial to treat any associated complications.
__label__1@  The ileal mesentery is then divided just medial to the pedicle to a proposed terminal ileum resection site approximately 5–10-cm from the ileocecal valve.
__label__1@  The fascia and skin are then closed at the midline incision, and all port sites are closed.
__label__2@  Fifteen patients underwent roboticassisted resection with the da Vinci robotic surgical system. 
__label__1@  Remember to use the Cadiere to improve the surgical exposure and view by grasping more proximal areas of the edge of the stomach along the greater curvature and moving the operative field toward the liver.
__label__1@  The distal margin is then stapled.
__label__2@  There has not been one technique that has clearly demonstrated benefit in reducing vaginal cuff dehiscence.
__label__1@  Alternatively, in the presence of small branches, we advise dividing one branch a time placing one or two Hem-o-lok clips proximally and divide it with the harmonic device.
__label__1@  Bring the camera arm in alignment with the camera trocar and target anatomy, and dock.
__label__1@  A closed suction drain is inserted through the incision under direct vision.

__label__2@  A single surgical team, specialized in thoracic surgery with experience in all aspects of video-assisted and robotic-assisted surgery, performed all operations. 
__label__1@  A 14-Fr red Robinson catheter is then advanced through the ileal segment and into the pouch itself, to facilitate tapering the ileal segment.
__label__1@  This can be obtained by using a uterine manipulator with a cervical cup and cutting on the cup’s base, or making other modifications to existing uterine manipulators.
__label__2@  Monopolar cautery should be avoided in the fossa of Marseille, as it may stimulate the obturator nerve and cause adduction of the ipsilateral leg.
__label__2@  This may help to facilitate identifying this plane.
__label__1@  The arms are placed at 45 on arm rests, and the patient is shifted to the right side of the bed to allow appropriate use of the liver retractor.
__label__1@  The balloon is attached to CO2 to maintain pneumo-retroperitoneum at 15 mmHg.
__label__2@  In patients with diffuse histology, the proximal and distal extents of the tumor cannot be predicted preoperatively.
__label__1@  If an oophorectomy is not planned, the IP ligament should be left intact and the utero-ovarian ligament and fallopian tube transected instead, in the same fashion.
__label__1@  Furthermore, for right-sided cases, the duodenum is kocherized medially to identify the anterior surface of the inferior vena cava.
__label__1@  In the renal clamping group, the tumor was excised using laparoscopic scissors with bulldog clamps.
__label__1@  The suprapubic catheter is pulled taut and the pouch anchored to the anterior abdominal wall using the two Stamm polyglactin sutures.
__label__1@  The specimen and conduit are separated.
__label__2@  Both guidelines suggest that an extended LND be performed if dissection is indicated, although the optimal extent of LND for prostate cancer also remains unknown.
__label__2@  Tube feeding is begun and slowly advanced on postoperative day 2. 
__label__1@  For an intracorporeal anastomosis, any of the port sites can then be expanded for removal of the specimen.
__label__2@  Robot surgeries had a lower conversion  rate, 6 versus 10%. Morbidity and mortality were similar among the groups. 
__label__2@  The more proximal lymph node dissection is then completed.
__label__1@  Ensure that the afferent limb is held on tension by holding the end with arm 2 or arm 3.
__label__2@  Pneumoperitoneum is established via the Veress needle or the Hasson technique, at any of the proposed port sites, Palmer’s point, or at the umbilicus. 
__label__2@  Careful thought and clinical judgment is always needed in making these decisions.
__label__2@  The surgeon must ensure that a resection margin of 2–4 cm can be obtained with the transabdominal approach. 
__label__2@  The key to placement of the suprapubic site and the future stoma site is that the distance and orientation between two sites on the pouch match the corresponding sites on the skin.
__label__1@  This pocket can be created by peeling down the peritoneum from the midline or from a separately made L-shaped peritoneal incision.
__label__1@  The Xi system is usually positioned to the patient’s left or right side with the rotation of the robot boom determining the final arm positions.
__label__1@  We use sliding absorbable clips placed after each passage through the capsule to apply adequate pressure on renal parenchyma edges.
__label__1@  It is recommended to make a single-layer closure of the gastric incision with a running suture or interrupted stitches.
__label__2@  A posterior IVC tear may become difficult to identify and control.
__label__1@  Alternatively, to minimize interaction with the robotic assistant arm, the left arm may be tucked.
__label__1@  First, the proximal limit of the dissection is identified as the ureter crosses over the iliac vessels, which can often be seen through the peritoneum or by incising the peritoneum lateral to the obliterated umbilical artery.
__label__2@  The left arm will be controlled with the right hand and vice versa.
__label__2@  However, there was some suggestion that a transvaginal closure approach may be better than a robotic approach.
__label__1@  Dissection is continued en bloc up until the level of the azygos vein, which is divided with an endovascular stapler.
__label__1@  A ProGrasp may be used with the robotic third arm in cases where additional retraction is needed.
__label__1@  A linear stapler is placed in each limb and firing is performed.

__label__1@  It is then dissected proceeding with a sharp and blunt dissection.
__label__1@  If there is significant tension on this initial 6 o’clock suture, additional interrupted sutures can be used to reapproximate the posterior urethral plate.
__label__1@  The needle driver is passed through the ureteral anastomosis into the defect in the suture line; the stent is grasped, pulled through the afferent limb, and then passed into the ureter.

__label__1@  To improve the exposure, gentle downward retraction of the common hepatic artery (CHA) can be provided by the assistant.
__label__1@  A midline camera incision is marked preferably just above the umbilicus but no more than 23-cm from the supraxiphoid reference point.
__label__2@  Identification of the trigone and ureteral orifices is important to confirm absence of injury to the ureters.
__label__1@  During this time the assistant should always place gentle pressure of the uterine manipulator into the patient with a slightly anteverted position.
__label__2@  As the IP ligament contains a major blood supply to the ovary that comes from the aorta, care should be taken to ensure adequate coagulation of the IP ligament.
__label__1@  A wound protector is placed, and the colon is extracorporealized.
__label__1@  The obturator nerve and vessels are identified as they course into the obturator foramen.
__label__1@  We frequently establish pneumoperitoneum to 15 mmHg via the Veress needle inserted near Palmer’s point.
__label__2@  This is also a purple Tri- Staple™ load or a blue small-bowel Endo-GIA load.
__label__2@  Often the natural attachments of the sigmoid colon will aid with retraction and should not be taken down immediately. 
__label__2@  Of importance is complete or partial removal of the seminal vesicles, depending on disease stratification.

__label__1@  The bladder flap is created and anterior vaginal wall exposed while the uterine manipulator is in place regardless of the type of hysterectomy planned.
__label__1@  Finally, the distal esophagus is divided with a linear stapler.
__label__1@  If nerve sparing is not planned, the pedicle to the prostate and neurovascular bundle can also be stapled, extending to the apex of the prostate (Fig.14.5).
__label__1@  The renorrhaphy sutures can now be introduced and temporarily situated near the operative field.
__label__1@  The assistant port should be a standard 10-mm trocar to allow the easy passage of needles if suturing.
__label__2@  The available monopolar instruments include the EndoWrist Hot Shears Monopolar Curved Scissors, the Permanent Cautery Hook, and the Permanent Cautery Spatula.
__label__2@  In the case of concomitant hysterectomy, whether total or supracervical, uterine manipulation to achieve views anterior and posterior to the uterus is important.
__label__1@  For right-sided cases, the duodenum needs to be kocherized to identify the underlying IVC.
__label__1@  The peritoneum is incised starting at the vaginal apex.
__label__1@  During excision, the assistant can help expose and maintain countertraction using a suction device and a laparoscopic peanut instrument.
__label__1@  Next, an incision was made to mobilize the kidney from the perirenal fat, revealing the renal artery and primary tumor.
__label__1@  The procedure begins by ensuring that all omentum and small bowel are out of the way and then identifying the ileocolic pedicle.
__label__1@  This dissection can be accomplished with sharp dissection to avoid thermal enteric injury.
__label__1@  A 10-mm, 12-mm, or 15-mm trocar can be used for the assistant, but 15 mm is preferred.
__label__1@  In either case, the two limbs of bowel should be approximated with a stay stitch distally.
__label__1@  The Keith needle is passed back out of the abdomen near the entry site.
__label__1@  Drain output volumes are meticulously monitored after Foley removal because any significant increase may represent vesicoureteral reflux into a persistent or unrecognized collecting system injury.
__label__2@  Excising this fatty tissue also improves visualization for the subsequent dissection of the bladder neck.
__label__2@  Similar care is needed to achieve the appropriate tension to the tissues to facilitate tissue dissection.
__label__2@  The clip has a long suture attached to it for ease of identification and atraumatic manipulation of the ureter during urinary diversion. 
__label__1@  An ultrasound probe is introduced through the assistant's port to identify the limits and depth of the tumor.
__label__2@  Carrying this dissection through the posterior bladder neck reveals the anterior Denonvilliers fascial layer that covers the vas deferens and seminal vesicles (see Section “Dissection of the Vas Deferens, Seminal Vesicles, and Posterior Prostate”) or the posterior space if dissection of the vas deferens and seminal vesicle has already been performed.
__label__1@  After tumor removal, a hemostatic matrix was placed into the renal cavity, and a fibrin sealant was injected to cover the entire hemostatic matrix and the surrounding normal renal tissue.
__label__1@  The colonic flexure is identified and reflected medially over the kidney along the white line of Toldt.
__label__1@  To create the necessary additional exposure, pull the stomach to the patient’s left.
__label__1@  Once just the DVC is within the jaws of the stapler, the complex is stapled and divided.
__label__1@  Removing most of the fat from the renal surface serves to make the kidney more mobile and also allows more versatility for intraoperative ultrasound (US) viewing as well as tumor resection and suturing angles.
__label__2@  Without proper tension to the tissue, excessive cauterization to the tissues can occur.
__label__1@  Frozen section results were used to determine feasibility and the type of resection.
__label__1@  A 19-Fr round Blake drain is then placed through the left pararectus port site into the pelvis and ending next to the ureteroileal anastomoses adjacent to the proximal end of the conduit.
__label__2@  We suggest at least 1.5 cm total spatulation.
__label__2@  In general, unless adrenal tissue is grossly involved, it may be spared
__label__1@  The robot should be arranged so that the camera arm is aligned with the center column, and instrument arms 1 and 2 have straight setup joints.
__label__1@  If this occurs, the surgeon considers a low threshold for the performance of tube thoracostomy.
__label__2@  Our goal is to excise as much redundant ileal segment as possible to create an easily catheterizable channel.
__label__2@  The right adrenal gland is typically more cephalad than the left.
__label__1@  A split-and-roll technique is used to expose the anterior surface of the aorta.
__label__2@  Surgeon experience, patient age, male sex, and the degree of inflammation all affect the identification of biliary anatomy. 
__label__2@  Patients are usually discharged once pain control is adequate and there are no signs of complications. 
__label__1@  One of the critical steps in obtaining safe and adequate exposure to the renal hilum is lateral and anterior retraction of the kidney, which can be achieved by starting dissection caudal to the inferior pole of the kidney to identify the ureter, gonadal vessels, and underlying psoas muscle.
__label__1@  For an intracorporeal anastomosis, both resection sites — the terminal ileum and transverse colon — are then divided with the robotic stapler.
__label__1@  Using a stapling device is the most convenient way to perform the resection.
__label__2@  During surgery, certain circumstances can arise that make robotic surgery more challenging.
__label__1@  By a selective vagotomy the intestinal vagal fibers can be preserved.
__label__1@  This mobilization is continued to the mid transverse colon.
__label__1@  Postoperatively, patients are extubated in the operating room and should be observed in a monitored setting.
__label__2@  This creates a draping of the omentum separates the stomach from the colon, and provides the initial exposure to enter the lesser sac.
__label__2@  Balancing the real and theoretical benefits of LND against the time and comorbidity to perform the procedure is important.
__label__2@  All the other ports are performed under direct view guidance. 
__label__1@  To do this correctly, the trocar is inserted with the port facing the anterior abdomen towards the assistant.
__label__1@  Dissection on either side of the DVC in order to isolate it by endopelvic fascia opening or nerve sparing prepares the anatomy for DVC ligation.
__label__2@  This is typically on postoperative day 1 with a follow-up visit in 2 weeks.
__label__2@  Passing this stapler load through the upper-most assistant port typically gives the best angle.
__label__1@  After completing the anastomosis, additional stay sutures are placed lateral and anterior to the anastomosis site to hold the bowel to the pelvis.
__label__1@  A stepwise dissection from proximal to distal involves first prospectively identifying the course of the ureter as it crosses over the iliac vessels.
__label__1@  The leftward thymic extent can be dissected in a cephalad manner.
__label__1@  This blunt sweeping is carried down to the endopelvic fascia.
__label__1@  Then, as the soft tissue along the anterior proper hepatic artery is being dissected, the right gastric artery can be identified at its base, isolated, ligated, and divided for retrieval of the lymph node station 5.
__label__2@  Port placement also should account for the patient’s abdominal wall girth and the intraabdominal anatomy, because the distance between the ports and the placement of the ports determine the reach and direction of the robotic instruments.
__label__2@  The luminal intestine is not separated from the mesentery for an isolated staple fire.
__label__2@  For an extracorporeal anastomosis, the robotic portion of the operation is terminated at this point. 
__label__1@  It is important that all pressure points are properly padded.
__label__1@  The levator muscles are bluntly dissected away from the bladder.
__label__2@  In patients with a wide bladder, it may be necessary to reduce its caliber to sew down to the urethra.
__label__1@  The mesentery at this location is divided toward the root of the mesentery for a distance of approximately 8–10-cm at the bloodless plane of Treves.
__label__1@  We complete the procedure separating the posterior part of the oblique fissure.
__label__2@  Similar to standard laparoscopy, robotic multiport cholecystectomy can generally be performed as an outpatient or short-stay procedure. 
__label__2@  Changing back to the zero degree lens for this portion of the operation improves the ability to dissect toward the apex.
__label__1@  The room layout has to accommodate this docking configuration.
__label__1@  A retractor is placed on the end of the colon.
__label__1@  The pelvic dissection requires arm 2 to move to trocar 4 and arm 3 to move to trocar 3.
__label__1@  Once completely excised, the mass is then placed into a laparoscopic bag via the working port.
__label__1@  Sharp and blunt dissection drop the levator muscles away from the DVC so that what remains attached anteriorly is this venous complex.
__label__1@  Liver and kidney grafts were prepared for implantation on the back-table as usual.
__label__1@  The sutures for the right ureter, left ureter, terminal ileum, and the red Robinson catheter that had previously been secured on the grasper are now delivered through the incision.
__label__1@  The patient cart is placed in a side-docking position.
__label__1@  An identical procedure is replicated on the left side.
__label__1@  The anterior portion of the urethra is first divided, maximizing the urethral stump.
__label__1@  Bulldog clamps can be removed after base suturing is completed to minimize warm ischemia.
__label__2@  The ureter is never handled with instruments.
__label__2@  Additionally, patients with prolapse and a short vaginal length may benefit from the sacrocolpopexy as some transvaginal approaches have been associated with decreased vaginal length postoperatively.
__label__1@  Finally, the node of Cloquet is clipped distally and used as a handle for exposure beneath the external iliac vessels and into the obturator fossa.
__label__1@  The cut ileocolic pedicle is grasped and retracted medially and superiorly.
__label__1@  Tumor excision can be started using monopolar cautery through the renal cortex, followed by sharp excision around the tumor including a margin of normal tissue.
__label__1@  If so, the robotic port is placed in the most medial and inferior aspect of the field 7–8 cm beyond and 2 cm below the medial robotic port.
__label__2@  At least 1 randomized prospective study has cited decreased pulmonary complications and improved perioperative outcomes with minimally invasive esophagectomy in comparison with open resection.
__label__2@  In a small retrospective study comparing combined spinal and general anesthesia to general anesthesia alone, patients in the combined group used less intravenous opioids during and after the procedure.
__label__1@  Gentle retraction of the stomach by the robotic assistant arm allows for exposure and additional dissection of the left crus from the lesser gastric curve.
__label__2@  Routine assessment of the risks and benefits of all trocars is advised.
__label__2@  These also aid in hemostasis of the Mayo vein. 
__label__1@  Arm 3 will be to the left of the robot, pointed down for the pelvis.
__label__1@  Enter through the fascia carefully, and use a finger to check for and sweep away any underlying intraabdominal adhesions.
__label__1@  The trocars should be at least 10-cm apart and at an approximately 30 angle.
__label__1@  The IP ligament should then be tented away from the ureter by using the monopolar scissor.
__label__1@  Dissection is continued superiorly by first opening the mediastinal pleura along the hilum, with the lung retracted anterior-medially.
__label__1@  It is not necessary and might be risky to perform a wide mobilization of the colon.
__label__1@  Once near the urethra, the incision deviates to the mesentery, to keep the urethral anastomosis away from the incision.
__label__1@  The remaining robotic trocars are inserted under direct laparoscopic visualization.
__label__1@  The entire urethra and urethral meatus with a cuff of vaginal mucosa is then excised using cautery.
__label__1@  Sometimes it is necessary to secure the proximal end of the conduit to the retroperitoneum in order to stabilize the bowel for the anastomosis.
__label__1@  The stomal mucosa is everted as these sutures are tightened.
__label__2@  Caution should be taken to ensure adequate clip placement, as the lumbar veins can retract if divided unsecured.
__label__2@  Trocars should all be placed 8–10  cm apart to avoid robotic instrument arm collisions.
__label__1@  The lymphatics distal to Cloquet’s node should be ligated using clips or cautery.
__label__2@  The SPIDER (Single-Port Instrument Delivery Extended Research) device (TransEnterix, Research Triangle Park, NC) has been designed to improve the laparoscopic single-site surgical environment with reapproximation of triangulated instruments and camera. 
__label__1@  Any variation or abnormality in the colonoscopy report should prompt the surgeon to perform another colonoscopy personally to confirm the findings.
__label__2@  Creating a larger fascial incision may result in slipping of the port into or out of the abdomen and will create difficulty in maintaining a pneumatic seal.
__label__1@  The surgeon console should be placed in one corner or edge of the operating room, to provide the surgeon with a panoramic view of the patient and ready access to the patient.
__label__1@  The spine and hip must be positioned in a straight line, and the spine fully exposed to allow space for placement of the lateral robotic arm.
__label__2@  It is important that once the ports are docked to the robotic arms, further positioning of the patient cannot occur without first undocking the arms.
__label__1@  The grasper is used to hold the bowel and stents near the distal end.
__label__1@  Meticulous tumor dissection was carried out in order to ensure grossly negative margins.
__label__2@  Instrument arms should be spaced far enough apart to avoid collisions.
__label__1@  Bipolar cautery can be used to coagulate the IP ligament.
__label__1@  Then dissection should be carried to the crus of the diaphragm to exposure the medially extent of the left adrenal gland.
__label__2@  We believe obtaining a “critical view of safety” is just as important in robotically-assisted multiport cholecystectomy as it is in standard laparoscopic cholecystectomy. 
__label__2@  The sixth step is En Bloc Esophageal Mobilization.
__label__2@  It provides surgeons the opportunity not only to more easily adopt minimally invasive surgery to benefit our gastric cancer patients but also to identify the utility of integrating novel technology in improving the outcome of our cancer patients. 
__label__1@  The surgeon can utilize one of the robot arms with a grasper that assist with manipulating the uterus in the proper position.
__label__1@  Gently tent the IP ligament medially and carefully dissecting the areolar tissue in the retroperitoneal space until the ureter is identified.
__label__1@  The Foley catheter is then withdrawn, and a large clip is then placed on the urethra at its entrance into the prostatic apex, to avoid spillage of urine.
__label__1@  An additional pass of the suture more anteriorly is used to secure the complex before tying down.
__label__2@  As with the earlier study, operative time was significantly longer in the robot group (195 vs. 130 min), and the costs were also higher ($9000 vs. $6000). 
__label__1@  Generally, the left ureter is attached first.
__label__2@  However, pleural adhesions do not represent per se a contraindication to robotic surgery. 
__label__1@  The procedure is then replicated for the right uretero-enteric anastomosis.
__label__1@  A large sigmoid window should be created to allow adequate room for the left ureter to be transposed to the right abdomen without kinking later.
__label__2@  These sutures should incorporate a larger seromuscular bite and a smaller mucosal bite to allow for adequate inversion of the mucosa.
__label__1@  Once visualization of the posterior wall of the stomach confirms entrance to the lesser sac, the posterior wall is retracted by the bedside assistant anteriorly and to the right.
__label__1@  A hybrid option at this stage would be to take down the splenic flexure prior to any robotic work.
__label__1@  Following fascial closure, the abdomen may be reinsufflated to ensure hemostasis and to allow for perioperative drain placement, if appropriate.
__label__1@  The superior vesical arteries on both sides are then clipped at their takeoff from the internal iliac artery and divided distally using the robotic vessel sealer device.
__label__2@  Diagnostic surgery of the anterior mediastinum includes mediastinoscopy (anterior and cervical) and thoracoscopy. 
__label__1@  After the kidney is exposed, the hilum is dissected, and renal vessels are isolated to prepare for clamping.
__label__1@  It can also be stapled closed by placing stay stitches on each end of the opening.
__label__1@  Once the gallbladder is retracted, the camera must then be positioned to visualize the target anatomy.
__label__1@  To separate the bronchus, we introduce the stapler again from the posterior port (arm 2).
__label__2@  Such data are important for prognosis and guiding additional therapy.
__label__1@  In this way, liver, native kidneys, and both iliac fossae were easily accessible.
__label__1@  This tissue will be easily removed from the medial aspect of the vessels later.
__label__1@  A 6- to 8-cm incision is made around the umbilicus, a wound protector is placed, and the colon is brought outside the body.
__label__1@  Vaginal probes, EEA Sizers (Medtronic Minimally Invasive Therapies, Minneapolis, MN), or a sponge stick may be used to make the colpotomy if uterine manipulation is not felt to be necessary, or if a large cervical tumor prohibits placement of a manipulator.
__label__1@  The peritoneum is closed with absorbable suture in one or two lengths, taking care to extraperitonealize the mesh.
__label__2@  This supports using a high anterior release of the prostatic fascia to preserve the nerves in this location.
__label__1@  The tumor specimen can be placed in an endoscopic retrieval bag and extracted through the 12-mm assistant port or the fourth arm port site.
__label__1@  This dissection is made much easier by a full mobilization medially first.
__label__1@  The left crux of the diaphragm is now identified, the peritoneum overlying it is incised, and the crural muscle fibers are identified.
__label__1@  Sharp dissection can be accomplished with the robotic scissors to develop this plane and avoid thermal injury to the bladder.
__label__2@  In one patient we concluded that a biopsy-proven thymoma was extracapsular. 
__label__2@  Return precautions include fever, jaundice, worsening abdominal pain, abdominal distension, persistent nausea or vomiting, and problems with bowel or bladder function. 
__label__1@  The camera port is placed just above the indentation of the erector spinae muscles in the space under the 12th rib.
__label__1@  The pylorus is freed from adjacent connective tissue, and the lesser omentum is opened along the minor curvature.
__label__2@  Usually, stapled anastomoses are quicker, but they may require expertise at the bedside for assistance.
__label__2@  Initially, the shape and size of the prostate is visually gauged, and the Foley balloon can be deflated to show where the collapsed bladder ends and the prostate begins.
__label__1@  We then introduce a 10-mm 30-degree VATS camera to explore the chest cavity and confirm the absence of pleural effusion and metastasis.
__label__1@  Robotic 8-mm trocars are used throughout.
__label__2@  These stay sutures should be air knots and cut by the assistant to be 3 cm in length.
__label__2@  Standard monofilament or braided sutures may also be used without much additional difficulty, given the ease of knot-tying afforded by the superior dexterity of the robotic system.
__label__2@  In the non-nerve-sparing or high-risk patient, the posterior dissection should be performed in the perirectal fat plane.
__label__1@  When removing the left ovary and tube, the procedure is initiated by placing the infundibulopelvic ligament and round ligament under tension.
__label__1@  The same technique is applied to the contralateral side as shown in (Fig.12.5).
__label__2@  There is no contraindication to keeping the patient supine, but this position helps to keep the patient from moving and allows the surgeon to operate between the legs on the rare occasion when that is needed. 
__label__1@  An antimesenteric incision is then made, beginning at the distal end of the loop and moving toward the site of the urethral anastomosis.
__label__1@  This plane can be entered by incising through both layers of Denonvilliers’ fascia lateral to the rectum.
__label__2@  When stapling the proximal bowel (between the paired Vicryl sutures), only one staple load is needed.
__label__2@  The mean operative time in the 3 patients who underwent an extended thymectomy through a median sternotomy was 140 minutes (range 118 to 164). 
__label__2@  the pararectal space, is defined by the ureter and posterior broad ligament medially, the internal iliac vessels laterally, and the cardinal ligament anteriorly.
__label__2@  The borders of station 
__label__2@  The adrenal gland often has a variable network of arterial blood supply arising from the renal artery, aorta, and inferior phrenic artery, whereas venous drainage is more consistent.
__label__2@  This allows for the retraction of the divided RGEV and exposure of the right gastroepiploic artery, which is usually located more posteriorly as it branches from the gastroduodenal artery (GDA). 
__label__1@  The 12-mm port is used to introduce laparoscopic bulldog clamps.
__label__1@  This dissection is continued anteriorly up to the dorsal venous complex.
__label__1@  A hook electrocautery is attached to arm 4.
__label__1@  The OR table should be positioned so that the robot can be positioned over the patient’s right shoulder, and the anesthesiologist can still maintain access to the patient’s airway and intravenous access.
__label__1@  Patients are routinely positioned in the dorsal lithotomy position using Yellowfins stirrups.
__label__1@  The right renal artery should be prospectively identified prior to ligation of the lumbar arteries to ensure that it is not inadvertently ligated.
__label__1@  If the ovaries and fallopian tubes are being spared, one must also first isolate the utero-ovarian ligament.
__label__1@  Arterial mapping with this superselective ligation approach is done until only branches to the tumor(s) are clamped and the rest of the kidney is free from ischemia.
__label__1@  A 2-0 silk suture is placed through the Veil of Treves at the terminal ileum.
__label__1@  We do not leave any drain postoperatively as we showed that it does not decrease the incidence of complications.
__label__1@  This dissection is continued distally up to the urethra.
__label__2@  This is performed in a similar fashion as previously described; The ureteral anastomosis is started once the wall furthest away from the camera is complete.
__label__1@  The remainder of the ports can be removed under vision in order to inspect for internal bleeding from the port tract.
__label__2@  They are monitored for nausea, pain, urinary output (with a Foley catheter), and infection.
__label__1@  With the ileal segment used for neobladder placed inferiorly, a stapled side-to-side bowel anastomosis is then performed using the GIA stapler.
__label__1@  A 30-degree 5-mm telescope was placed through a 10-mm port in the fifth intercostal space in the midaxillary line.
__label__1@  Following this, the robot is undocked, the patient flattened out, the port sites are closed, and the procedure is completed.
__label__2@  The indications for robotic colon surgery should parallel those of laparoscopic surgery. 
__label__1@  The limb is then brought through this incision and is pulled anteriorly until the excess limb is outside the skin.
__label__2@  The potential advantage of the intracorporeal technique is that it requires less mobilization of the transverse colon, as the extracorporeal technique requires the transverse colon to reach outside the body.
__label__1@  The tumor is resected with a 5-mm parenchymal safety margin, using cold scissors while the assistant clears the resection bed and performs a countertraction with the suction device to improve visualization of the safety margin.
__label__2@  The standard template for lymphadenectomy in a radical nephrectomy is contingent upon the laterality of the procedure.
__label__1@  The robot is undocked, and either the left lower quadrant port site or the umbilical port site is expanded to a 6 to 8-cm incision.
__label__1@  Lateral retraction of the abdominal wall exposed therest of the abdomen.
__label__1@  The anastomosis is then tested by irrigating the Foley catheter.
__label__1@  A left colectomy for a descending colon tumor or splenic flexure tumor is adapted from these techniques with further mobilization of the transverse colon.
__label__2@  In healthcare systems that have already obtained the robotic platform and have the robotic infrastructure in place, cost-containment strategies involving minimizing instrument use and OR time utilization create a favorable financial picture for robotically-assisted cholecystectomy.
__label__1@  The assistant port is placed in the anterior axillary line just cephalad to the anterior superior iliac spine and 7–8 cm caudal to the medial robotic port.
__label__1@  We regularly start the procedure using the Si ® system with monopolar cautery with hook tip (instrument 1), Maryland bipolar forceps (instrument 2), and grasping forceps (instrument 3).
__label__1@  Retraction stitches are placed laterally across the pyloric muscle.
__label__2@  In the absence of complications, the expected hospital course is as follows.
__label__1@  the surgeon should ensure that the legs are well flexed at the hip.
__label__1@  The urethral meatus should be completely excised unless an orthotopic neobladder is planned.
__label__2@  The distal limit of dissection is the crossing of the circumflex iliac vein over the external iliac artery.
__label__2@  This also allows improved ventilation by anesthesia and allows port placement in the upper abdomen, which usually contains the thinnest portion of the abdomen and facilitates port placement.
__label__2@  This placement requires crossing of instruments and switching the hand controls for arms 1 and 2. 
__label__2@  Whether this contributes to survival is as yet unknown.
__label__1@  Before undocking the robot, the left ureter is transposed to the right abdomen underneath the sigmoid mesentery.
__label__1@  The peritoneum is then incised.
__label__1@  The inferior vein is isolated and then divided with at 30-mm vascular stapler that is always introduced from the utility incision.
__label__1@  Alternatively, the DVC can also be transected sharply and then similarly oversewn with an absorbable suture with the pneumoperitoneum turned up briefly to 20-mmHg.
__label__1@  The lateral right hand is held until the stent is pulled through the bowel.
__label__1@  The uterus is then retracted posteriorly.
__label__1@  Level 1 and 3 lymph nodes are dissected with the proximal stomach up to the right crux of the diaphragm.
__label__1@  A uterine manipulator is frequently used in radical hysterectomies and can facilitate visualization during the procedure, as well as demarcating the vaginal margin during colpotomy.
__label__1@  To divide them with a linear stapler, remove arm 2 of the robot from the 12-mm port in the right midclavicular line to allow the bedside assistant to use the stapler.
__label__2@  In some patients, visualizing the pelvic organs can be made difficult by certain patient factors.
__label__1@  The mucosal edges are then everted using 4-0 chromic sutures in the four quadrants of the enterotomy.
__label__1@  After the bladder peritoneum is incised just below the junction of the bladder and the cervix/uterus, the bladder peritoneum is gently tented anteriorly and caudally so that the plane between the bladder and cervix/uterus can be carefully developed.
__label__1@  We placed the robotic instruments before obtaining the tissue diagnosis in anticipation of performing a robotic-assisted resection.
__label__2@  Xi innovations allow for coordinated OR table movement even when the robot is docked.
__label__1@  The gallbladder is then removed from the liver bed by a standard approach, and the area is inspected to ensure hemostasis.
__label__2@  With the Si® system, we use three instrument arms and use a laparoscopic instrument and port in place of instrument arm 3 only if we have additional bedside assistants to aid with retraction. 
__label__1@  The initial en bloc dissection is begun along the pericardium adjacent to the inferior vena cava.
__label__1@  The patient is then draped and the bed-side assistant stands beside the abdomen.
__label__1@  When the bladder must be separated away from the uterus and cervix, the uterus should be in a neutral-to-slightly retroverted position to facilitate this dissection.
__label__1@  After the urethral anastomosis is complete, the distal staple line is removed.
__label__2@  We recommend avoiding horizontal fissure dissection (intermediate and upper lobe fissure), as it may lead to an air leak.
__label__1@  Continue to clear the soft tissue along the CHA to retrieve the 8a lymph node station.
__label__1@  The retrogastric space is then entered through the lesser curve, and the robotic assistant arm is used to gently retract the stomach anteriorly, thus exposing the left gastric vascular pedicle.
__label__1@  Place an 8-mm camera trocar and the 5-mm assistant trocar into the designated trocar sites.
__label__2@  The optimal dissection leaves no prostate behind so as to avoid a positive margin, cancer recurrence, or postoperative detectable prostate- specific antigen (PSA).
__label__2@  Control of the dorsal venous complex (DVC) during RARP may be achieved in various ways.
__label__2@  It is important to have the patient’s buttocks as close to the edge of the bed as possible, as the transanal stapler will be used later and the patient will often slide cephalad. 
__label__1@  To perform a four-arm robotic right middle lobectomy we prefer to proceed with the following sequence: middle lobe pulmonary vein; middle lobe bronchus; middle lobe branch(es) of the pulmonary artery; fissure.
__label__1@  In situations in which there is a large median lobe, a stitch can be used to retract the lobe out of the bladder.
__label__1@  This dissection is continued proximally until the takeoff of the inferior mesenteric artery is identified.
__label__2@  The proximal limit of an extended pelvic lymph node dissection is debated; this atlas focuses on the takeoff of the inferior mesenteric artery on the aorta as the proximal limit.
__label__2@  This will be replaced later with the vessel sealer and the stapler.
__label__2@  The sutures for the right ureter, left ureter, and terminal ileum are delivered through the incision.
__label__1@  Each suture is used to complete the urethra-neovesical anastomosis along each side, up to the 12 o’clock position.
__label__2@  Third step is Gastric Mobilization.
__label__1@  Stents are removed when the patient has had full return of bowel function.
__label__1@  The left subcostal 5-mm port is placed next, under direct vision, as laterally as possible, followed by placement of the left 8-mm port.
__label__2@  The learning curve for robotic multiport cholecystectomy is relatively short; proficiency may be reached in 20–30 cases. 
__label__2@  The camera can be 0-degree or 30-degree. 
__label__1@  Following placement of ports and instruments, the colon is identified and reflected medially over the kidney along the white line of Toldt.
__label__2@  The junction of the prostate and bladder neck can be identified by the tissue differences between the bladder neck fibers and the firmer more defined prostatic tissue.
__label__2@  As a surgeon’s individual and institutional experience with robotic total gastrectomy increases, it is reasonable to expand indications for a robotic total gastrectomy to include patients with worse medical comorbidities, more advanced disease, and a higher BMI.
__label__2@  In this case, we proceeded with the usual sequential steps as for lobectomy for lung cancer. 
__label__1@  The vagina is closed, making sure to incorporate both peritoneum and vaginal mucosa.
__label__1@  An appropriate length can be obtained by placing the distal end of the harvested segment on the skin at the planned stomal site and measuring the length of ileum needed to perform tension-free uretero-enteric anastomoses.
__label__1@  To use of two separate peritoneal incisions, one near the posterior cervix or vagina and the other near the sacral promontory, in order to avoid the extra time involved in peritoneal closure.
__label__1@  If a urinary catheter was placed before surgery, it is removed in post-operative recovery room.
__label__2@  Care should be taken to avoid stripping the ureter of its vascular supply, and much of the fatty tissue adjacent to the ureter should be left in place.
__label__1@  As in subtotal gastrectomy, the stomach is mobilized and freed from the omentum, and the pylorus is isolated.
__label__1@  A scissor is used to cut off 1-cm of the distal staple line close to the abdominal wall.
__label__1@  This can be performed with the LigaSure device or suture ligations of crossing mesenteric vessels with 3-0 silk sutures.
__label__1@  The inferior mesenteric vein is identified at its origin, coming out underneath the duodenum.
__label__1@  A 12-mm assistant port is placed under direct vision at the diaphragmatic insertion.
__label__1@  A speculum is first inserted to obtain adequate visualization of the cervix.
__label__1@  Using a combination of blunt dissection and electrocautery, the posterior aspect of the pylorus and the proximal duodenum are gently elevated off of the retroperitoneum.
__label__1@  Additional retraction by the bedside assistant is useful to completely expose this area.
__label__1@  The procedure is then replicated for the right uretero- enteric anastomosis.
__label__2@  This patient had a primary thymic carcinoid tumor. 
__label__1@  If needed, the ureter can be incised more proximally to increase the amount of spatulation.
__label__1@  The lobe should be pulled anteriorly and upward to make the bronchus more vertical.
__label__1@  The detubularized colonic segment is then folded on itself in Heineke-Mikulicz fashion, and the edges are sewn together using 3-0 polyglactin suture, with the same technique as described above.
__label__1@  A 7-cm midline incision is then made below the umbilicus, and the rectus fascia and peritoneum are opened.
__label__2@  Savera and colleagues described the neurovascular bundles as not just posterolateral nerve bundles but as a “Veil of Aphrodite” that incorporates the lateral prostatic fascia.
__label__1@  For safe positioning of larger women, bed extenders or arm sleds may be required.
__label__2@  Performing a robotic lobectomy in the presence of a chronic inflammatory/infectious status can be more challenging. 
__label__1@  Patients with clinically earlystage lesions (T1b or T2 with no evidence of local lymph node metastases) are referred for surgery.
__label__1@  Clear the soft tissue off the greater curvature of the stomach until the proximal resection margin is reached.
__label__2@  Generally, the left ureter is attached first.
__label__2@  This stage of the procedure involves dissection and removal of the vas deferens and seminal vesicles as well as mobilizing the prostate off the rectum 
__label__2@  The first randomized trial comparing minimally invasive surgery and laparotomy for radical hysterectomy in the management of early-stage cervical cancer was recently presented.
__label__2@  Conversion rates were lower when using robotic technologies, but much of the data is confounded with previous abdominal surgery and technique selection in those patients. 
__label__2@  A systematic approach must be applied in either lymph node dissection by using anatomic landmarks throughout the dissection to avoid iatrogenic injury of structures including the genitofemoral nerve laterally, the ureter medially, and the obturator nerve.
__label__1@  The index finger is then inserted into this space.
__label__2@  The suprapubic catheter is removed at 3  weeks when a pouchogram confirms no extravasation.
__label__1@  The uterine artery may then be transected lateral to the ureter, using bipolar and then monopolar cautery.
__label__2@  Robot-assisted sutured anastomosis is another option and can easily be performed using the robotic needle drivers.
__label__2@  Bleeding in this area can be life-threatening. 
__label__1@  The drain and stents are secured to the skin.
__label__2@  Several methods to achieve hemostasis in this area include application of direct pressure, increased insufflation pressure, application of hemostatic agents, oversewing with suture, and application of thumbtacks. 
__label__1@  The lymph node packet is dissected away from the obturator nerve and vessels, with care taken to avoid the use of monopolar cautery in this location.
__label__1@  If pneumoperitoneum is not established through the umbilicus, a 10–12-mm trocar is then placed either directly above or below the umbilicus (depending on the patient's habitus).
__label__1@  Then, identify the first set of short gastric vessels.
__label__1@  As omentectomy proceeds toward the splenic flexure, the short gastric vessels are identified and ligated under direct vision by the energy sealant device in arm 1.
__label__1@  As the left dog-ear is closed, leave 5-cm open to allow passage of the stents.
__label__1@  With the retrograde approach, the neurovascular bundle is released anteriorly and near the apex, and the urethra is incised.
__label__2@  Staying above the tape, and thus the pannus, also facilitates open surgery.
__label__1@  Hemostatic agents such as Surgiflo® (Ethicon), BioGlue® (CryoLife), or Evicel® (Ethicon) may be applied as per surgeon preference.
__label__2@  This maneuver prevents inadvertent avulsion of gonadal vein from inferior vena cava (IVC).
__label__1@  An additional 8-mm port is placed laterally in approximately the eighth or ninth interspace.
__label__2@  Mesh may be configured into a single rectangular piece or a “Y” shape. 
__label__2@  The Fenestrated Bipolar Forceps have more grasping strength and a broader area of cautery, whereas the Maryland Bipolar Forceps possess a finer tip that facilitates better dissection.
__label__1@  Under direct view, the bed-assistant start introducing the operative robotics arms.
__label__1@  Using the linear stapler, the jejunojejunostomy is created another 60–70-cm downstream, and the common enterotomy of the end-to-side anastomosis is closed with running 2-0 silk.
__label__1@  Lumbar vessels are identified and can be ligated with Hem-o-lok ® clips at this time, as seen in (Fig.15.6).
__label__1@  The hepatic flexure is taken down using cautery.
__label__2@  Institutional experience with, and support for, robotic operations is essential for the safe performance of robotic surgery at any anatomic location. 
__label__1@  ICG (3.5–5-mg reconstituted), which is excreted in bile, is injected 45 minutes prior to planned imaging.
__label__1@  The proximal 5-cm segment is then excised and discarded.
__label__2@  The proximal border of the precaval and paracaval lymph node dissection is the level of the takeoff from the aorta of the inferior mesenteric artery.
__label__1@  With a robotic approach, proper tension will need to be applied to the uterus by utilizing a uterine manipulator and either an assistant port or one of the robot arms to grasp the tissue to apply the necessary tissue tension.
__label__1@  Anterior traction is placed on the uterus, and the posterior peritoneum is retracted toward the sacrum.
__label__1@  The fascia must be closed for any port site larger than 1-cm, generally the camera port when using the da Vinci S or Si, and the accessory port.
__label__1@  The endopelvic fascia can be opened at this point, although this is optional.
__label__2@  The Monopolar Curved Scissors allow the most versatility because they can be used to cut tissue without cautery and, when closed, are useful in blunt dissection as well.
__label__2@  While pathologists are examining the margins, the Roux-en-Y jejunojejunostomy is created.
__label__2@  Mesh type and configuration depend on surgeon preference and the pelvic floor defects to be repaired. 
__label__1@  A GIA stapler is used to staple and divide the ileum at this location.
__label__1@  Identifying the " sweet spot " of the robotic camera arm and positioning the arms to allow for maximal arm movement will decrease the need to reposition the robotic arms during the operation.
__label__1@  The robotic instrument arms are removed from the surgical field.
__label__2@  It is required to prevent open conversion, an unnecessary increase in operative time, and surgeon frustration. 
__label__1@  Once in the pelvis, the neobladder is held in place using the robotic fourth arm on the 0 polyglactin 6 o’clock suture.
__label__2@  The authors use a 4-arm robotic platform with 2 operating consoles. 
__label__1@  Two 3-0 absorbable barbed sutures that are looped together are then brought in and are placed in the neobladder neck on each side of the 3-0 polyglactin suture and then in their corresponding location in the posterior urethra.
__label__2@  Use of the dock assist device can help facilitate arm docking.
__label__1@  The fascia is closed at the port sites if the trocar is 10-mm or larger.
__label__1@  The needle is carefully passed anterior to the urethra so as not to injure the urethra or sphincter mechanism.
__label__1@  The right ureter can be passed lateral or medial to the conduit.
__label__2@  Three key maneuvers to optimize exposure prior to the start of the main portion of the procedure and to facilitate accurate resection are complete gastric decompression, selfsustaining liver retraction, and proper placement of the robotic trocars.
__label__1@  A small disk of skin is then excised at the right pararectus port site.
__label__1@  The 12-mm and 10-mm sleeves included in the GelPOINT package are used as assistant's ports.
__label__2@  When coupled with robotic surgery, the length of stay is significantly reduced.
__label__1@  All ports not in use are removed, except those holding the ileal conduit and stents.
__label__1@  The process is repeated on the right side.
__label__2@  Misidentification of the biliary duct is the most common reason for major bile duct injury.
__label__1@  After establishment of pneumoperitoneum, the colon is medially reflected along the white line of Toldt.
__label__1@  Instrument arms should be spaced far enough apart to avoid collisions.
__label__1@  After exposure of the renal hilum, the main renal artery and vein are circumferentially mobilized and encircled with vessel loops.
__label__1@  It is then followed medially to the great vessels.
__label__1@  Laparoscopic dissection prior to docking the robot is often optimal during the early stages of the procedure.
__label__2@  Visualization of the uterus is often facilitated by robotic surgery.
__label__1@  The anterior leaflet of Denonvilliers’ fascia is incised in the midline, and the plane between the two leaflets is developed bluntly and sharply toward the apex of the prostate and laterally to the neurovascular bundles.
__label__1@  Following satisfactory port setup, the abdomen is explored for adhesions, evidence of previously unrecognized peritoneal disease, and extraluminal identification of the tumor.
__label__1@  The incisions are then closed in standard fashion.
__label__1@  The gonadal vein can be ligated if interfering with the dissection, and otherwise it should be positioned medially below the site of dissection.
__label__1@  If the tumor is not appreciable, especially in the case of tumors at the gastroesophageal junction, endoscopy should be utilized to confirm its location.
__label__1@  Single dock the robot and do not move any arms.
__label__1@  For its closure, the staple line is oversewn with interrupted seromuscular stitches.
__label__1@  The robotic instruments are then removed, and the robot is undocked.
__label__1@  The ports should be placed in a straight line starting at the suprapubic port and travelling cranially toward the left midclavicular line.

__label__2@  There have been descriptions of alternate techniques of morcellating the tissue in a bag.
__label__1@  If an orthotopic neobladder diversion is planned, a 3-0 polyglactin suture should be placed in the 6 o’clock position in the posterior urethral stump prior to division of the posterior urethra.
__label__2@  The crossing of the circumflex iliac vein over the artery is used as a distal limit.
__label__2@  It is best to decide preoperatively whether FireFly™ will be used, so the correct camera can be chosen and medication given before surgery.
__label__1@  The medial robotic port is inserted followed by the assistant port.
__label__1@  The stoma is matured in a standard fashion, and all 12-mm ports and the specimen extraction port are closed.
__label__2@  There are also several other possible complications: Intra-abdominal fluid collections or abscesses; Intraluminal and intra-abdominal bleeding; Pancreatitis, pancreatic leak, or pancreatic fistula; Anastomotic leak or stricture; Gastroparesis or ileus; Obstruction.
__label__1@  Otherwise, the endopelvic fascia is incised sharply bilaterally.
__label__1@  The hemostatic matrix was engorged within the airtight space covered by the fat pad just like a " pressure cooker ", causing extra external pressure to compress the postoperative bleeding.
__label__1@  If the specimen does not still pass through the vaginal canal, the surgeon must decide upon either an alternate route for or means of extraction.
__label__1@  The mesh is either tunneled under the peritoneum or placed within the peritoneal incision prior to attachment to the ALL.
__label__1@  The lymphatic tissue is dissected distally until it is contiguous with the previous pelvic dissections.
__label__1@  The specimen is removed through the vagina and inspected, to ensure that adequate margins have been achieved.
__label__1@  Once the anastomosis is finished, the bladder is filled with saline to test for an anastomotic leak.
__label__2@  Common bile duct injuries are serious complications that may arise in minimally invasive cholecystectomy. 
__label__1@  Trocar 3 is for retraction and can be the Cadiere or small grasping retractor.
__label__1@  The umbilical fascia defect is closed with interrupted 0-Vicryl suture, the umbilicus is tacked down to the fascia if necessary, and the skin closed with absorbable subcuticular suture.
__label__1@  This dissection is continued distally to the apex and, in retrograde fashion, back toward the base.
__label__2@  There is growing evidence of modest reductions, however, in conversions, length of stay, and return of bowel function when robotic surgery is performed.
__label__1@  The right adrenal gland is typically more cephalad than the left and thus will require liver retraction with a subxiphoid grasper instrument.
__label__1@  The posterior peritoneum can then be excised.
__label__1@  A 12-mm port is placed between the umbilical and the right midclavicular ports, and is used by the assistant for both suctioning and additional retraction.
__label__1@  The specimen is then extracted through the midline camera port by extending the skin and fascial incisions.
__label__1@  In right-sided cases, the ureter is isolated, leaving behind the gonadal vein next to the inferior vena cava.
__label__2@  Prior to urethral suturing, posterior reconstruction can be considered for hemostasis and to assist with performing the vesicourethral anastomosis.
__label__2@  If any bleeding occurs from the proximal IP ligament stump, one risks potential injury to the ureter when trying to cauterize this stump as it courses just under the IP ligament.
__label__1@  The dorsal venous complex is then ligated using the vessel sealer device.
__label__2@  It should intersect the midline with a supraumbilical camera port. 
__label__1@  The medial leaf of the broad ligament is incised to the desired transection point on the uterosacral ligament.
__label__2@  Ten patients were men, 8 were women, and their ages ranged from 23 to 74 years. 
__label__1@  The gastric mobilization is completed to the level of the pylorus, taking great care to visualize and preserve the gastroepiploic arcade at all times.
__label__2@  Avoid excessive reverse Trendelenburg, which will create difficulty by bringing the operative anatomy too close to the instruments.
__label__2@  The anastomosis is then completed. 
__label__1@  In the case of a posthysterectomy vaginal vault prolapse, to identify the cuff, assess for any cuff dehiscence, and close the cuff completely prior to mesh fixation.
__label__2@  There should be an average of 6–8  cm between ports to avoid arm clashing. 
__label__2@  These sutures should incorporate a larger seromuscular bite and a smaller mucosal bite to allow for adequate inversion of the mucosa. 
__label__2@  Seventh step is the creation of Circular Stapled.
__label__1@  Thus, all nodal-bearing tissue along the pericardium, airway, contralateral pleura, and aorta are removed with the specimen en bloc.
__label__1@  Continued and active cranial retraction of the bladder with frequent repositioning using the fourth robotic arm also helps delineate prostate glandular tissue from the muscular bladder fibers.
__label__1@  Although tactile feedback is blunted with robotic surgery, the KOH device or instrument that is used to delineate the cervicovaginal junction can still be readily identified by gently pressing against the tissue until the instrumentation (e.g., KOH cup) is palpated.
__label__1@  A segment of the urethra is then taken from the prostatic portion and sent for frozen-section pathologic analysis.
__label__2@  This exposes the structures for dissection.
__label__1@  In the case of a total hysterectomy, the vaginal cuff is closed prior to beginning RASC.
__label__2@  One recent meta-analysis comparing robotic gastrectomy with laparoscopic and open gastrectomy found that robotic surgery was associated with a shorter length of stay than open gastrectomy and lower intraoperative blood loss than laparoscopic surgery but longer operative time than either of the other approaches; morbidity and lymph node retrieval did not differ between the groups.
__label__1@  The urethra is dissected free.

__label__2@  The trajectory for passing the needle from side to side is completely horizontal.
__label__2@  If the specimen does not still pass through the vaginal canal, the surgeon must decide upon either an alternate route for or means of extraction.
__label__2@  The distal extent of the lateral border of dissection is the crossing of the circumflex iliac vein over the external iliac artery.
__label__2@  This blunt dissection through the perivesical fat allows for preservation of the bladder neck as it funnels into the prostate and for preemptive detection of large median lobes.
__label__1@  The defunctionalized limb can simply be sutured to the skin, and the intervening gaps can then be filled in with additional 2-0 polyglactin sutures.
__label__1@  A Babcock clamp is passed through the defect to grab the bowel and stents from the laparoscopic bowel grasper and is pulled through the stoma site.
__label__1@  Identification is also made easier by placing a grasper on the appendix and delivering it through the incision.
__label__1@  The dorsal venous complex is stapled and divided using a laparoscopic stapler (Fig.14.7).
__label__1@  Larger lymphatics can be clipped and divided.
__label__1@  This is placed back into the abdomen, and the incision site is closed partially, or a cap can be placed.
__label__1@  Ligate and divide the right gastroepiploic artery at this point.
__label__2@  A 2013 study looked at the National Inpatient Database and compared 2423 laparoscopic colectomies with 160 robotic ones. 
__label__2@  No conversions, intraoperative complications, or deaths occurred in the 15 patients who underwent roboticassisted resection. 
__label__2@  Radical hysterectomy performed with the robotic platform has been demonstrated to be a safe and feasible minimally invasive option in the management of earlystage cervical cancer, with or without SLN assessment.
__label__2@  Each approach has advantages and disadvantages, and the selection of the gastrointestinal reconstruction technique after robotic gastric cancer surgery will be guided by the extent of stomach resection and the surgeon’s preference. 
__label__1@  A zero-degree lens is used for this portion of the procedure.
__label__1@  Alternatively an endoscopic tissue grasper may be placed on the left side and locked on sigmoid epiploica for retraction.
__label__2@  If a complete mobilization was performed medially, only a thin layer of attachments should need to be incised. 
__label__1@  All patients are extubated in the operating room.
__label__1@  The urethra is divided along its anterior aspect sharply, distal to the clip.
__label__1@  With appropriate hilar retraction, the gonadal vein (leftside cases) or the IVC (right-side cases) can be traced toward the renal vein.

__label__1@  The ureteral anastomosis is performed before completing the anterior wall.
__label__1@  A small esophagotomy is made with electrocautery to allow the tube to be pulled into the peritoneal cavity.
__label__1@  A GIA stapler is then used to excise this excess ileum along the catheter, continuing up to the ileocecal valve; multiple staple loads may be required (Fig.14.19).
__label__1@  The ovary and fallopian tube are then mobilized medially toward the uterus.
__label__1@  After the specimen is removed, the fasciae and skin are closed.
__label__1@  The posterior dissection is completed along the aorta to the level of the hiatus, with careful identification and division of aortoesophageal perforating arteries.
__label__2@  These patients, who have an approximately 80% lifetime risk of developing gastric adenocarcinoma, nearly always have foci of high-grade dysplasia or intramucosal carcinoma within the stomach, and as such do not require more than a D1 lymphadenectomy.
__label__1@  Once the prostate pedicles are reached, these can be divided using plastic or metallic clips.
__label__1@  Using port and arm clutch maneuvers, the Si ® camera arm is attached to the umbilical trocar, instrument arm 1 is attached to the left upper quadrant trocar, instrument arm 2 is attached to the right upper quadrant trocar, and instrument arm 3 (optional) is attached to the lateral right upper quadrant trocar.
__label__2@  Sometimes the soft tissue around the middle bronchus may offer an individual resistance and may complicate the attempt to slide the stapler around it. 
__label__2@  However, to date, limited data have been reported on the feasibility of robotic anatomic lung resection for those patients and further studies should be encouraged. 
__label__1@  The obturator nodes are dissected off of the posterior surface of the vein.
__label__1@  Identify the RGEV and clear the vessel as it joins the ASPDV.
__label__2@  Debate continues over the optimal resectional approach in patients with isolated myasthenia gravis, with strong advocates for conservative cervical thymectomy, thoracoscopy, and radical transsternal resection.
__label__1@  The pedicle should then be divided close to its origin with either the vessel sealer or the white load stapler.
__label__1@  The bladder is mobilized down to the endopelvic fascia.
__label__1@  A larger vaginal margin is required in radical hysterectomy.
__label__1@  A standard laparoscopic 10-mm camera is placed into the obturator of the camera port, which is introduced into the chest in the eighth intercostal space in the mid to posterior axillary line under direct video guidance.
__label__1@  Once the patient is prepped and draped, the operation begins with the placement of the five required ports — four trocars for the robotic arms and one assist trocar.
__label__2@  The dorsal venous complex (see Section “Dorsal Venous Complex Control”) can be controlled at this time or alternatively prior to urethral transection.
__label__2@  This can include a large mass filling the pelvis (e.g., leiomyomata, ovarian mass), redundant rectosigmoid colon, obliteration of the posterior cul-de-sac, narrowed pelvis, and a short torso/abdomen in the cranial/caudal direction leading to small bowel filling the pelvis.
__label__1@  After the GelPOINT platform is inserted, the SP surgical system is docked.
__label__1@  Arms are typically tucked next to the patient’s abdomen bilaterally in order to facilitate surgeon and assistant access to the abdomen as well as to limit potential injury created by dynamic motions of robotic arms.
__label__1@  The colon is elevated cephalad to identify the ligament of Treitz.
__label__1@  The assistant passes a laparoscopic sucker through the enterotomy, and the antimesenteric border is incised to communicate with the previous enterotomy.
__label__1@  The posterior vaginal wall is then rotated anteriorly, and the vaginal opening is closed in clamshell fashion using either two continuous 0 barbed, absorbable sutures or polyglactin or monofilament absorbable sutures.
__label__1@  Alternatively, the outer renorrhaphy can be completed with a continuous running baseball stitch and a sliding Hem-o-loc clip after each wall-to-wall throw.
__label__1@  Partial thickness sutures are placed in the anterior and posterior vaginal walls and cervical stump, when present.
__label__1@  The assistant uses a suction irrigator, needle driver, and assorted graspers.
__label__2@  Instrument arm 3 is not used for this procedure and should be secured out of the way.
__label__2@  The risk of herniation is very low with the robotic 8 mm incisions, and, in general, these do not require fascial closure.
__label__1@  Isolate, ligate, and divide the RGEV at its base as it drains into the MCV.
__label__2@  The setup for the Xi® system is straightforward. 
__label__1@  A needle driver is placed in the medial right arm, and a Cadiere grasper in the remaining arms.

__label__2@  There were 35 patients in each randomized group comparing robotic right colectomy versus laparoscopic right colectomy.
__label__1@  A 3.5-cm umbilical incision is made, and a GelPOINT advanced access platform is inserted after placing a dedicated 25-mm multichannel robotic port and assistant's ports.
__label__2@  The anastomosis can either be isoperistaltic, with stapled ends on both sides of the anastomosis, or it can be antiperistaltic, with the stapled ends on the same side. 
__label__2@  Intraoperative cholangiography can be performed either via traditional cholangiography techniques or via the integrated FireFly near-infrared fluorescence cholangiography. 
__label__2@  The pedicles should be seen posterior and lateral with the prostate retracted anteriorly as in (Fig. 12.6).
__label__2@  Obesity is not a contraindication, but the working space is greatly reduced. 
__label__1@  This dissection is continued distally, and the obturator artery and vein are identified at their takeoffs from the internal iliac vessels.
__label__2@  Inflammatory bowel disease is another common colorectal disease that can be operated on with the robot.
__label__1@  Double dock the robot on the left _SP shoulder first and then the left leg.
__label__1@  In this location, the obturator nerve can be identified.
__label__2@  The fascia at this location is bluntly dilated to one fingerbreadth.
__label__1@  Maximal cephalad orientation of the vaginal apex is first demonstrated, followed by allowing the retractor to occupy the vagina without tension.
__label__2@  A drawback of the side-docked patient cart is that all robotic arms emerge from the patient’s left side, leaving limited space for dynamic motions.
__label__1@  The peritoneal incision is begun at the level of the sacral promontory and is carried all the way down to the posterior aspect of the cervix and/or vagina using Endo Shears.
__label__1@  A 30-degree down lens can assist with bladder neck dissection and in identifying the junction between the prostate and bladder.
__label__1@  Once the system is docked, the OR table cannot be moved.
__label__1@  To initiate the spatulation process, a scissor is placed into the medial right-hand port.
__label__1@  The conduit is reattached to the diaphragm to prevent retraction into the abdomen during the remainder of the dissection.
__label__1@  The omentum is retracted cephalad and the colon is retracted caudad.
__label__1@  The catheter is secured at the skin using a 0 silk suture.
__label__1@  The suture on the red Robinson catheter is cut, and this catheter is removed.
__label__1@  The right gastric artery is ligated at its base, lymphatic tissues along the proper and common hepatic arteries are swept medially toward the stomach, and a window is created at the level of the pylorus.
__label__1@  The authors prefer to partly skeletonize the proximal vascular pedicle, thus lifting all nodalbearing tissue along with the specimen.
__label__1@  In our series, a chest tube was left postoperatively in 5 patients to drain the operative hemithorax.
__label__1@  The Foley catheter is then capped and delivered through the vaginal opening into the abdominal cavity.
__label__2@  Nasogastric tubes are left in place for 5 to 7 days. 
__label__1@  The lobe is then extracted through a specimen retrieval bag.
__label__1@  Inspect the silicone port.
__label__2@  The first comparison of laparoscopic versus robotic right colectomy was a retrospective review from 2010. 
__label__2@  Taking some time to skeletonize the uterine vessels may help to reduce the tissue thickness and improve cauterization of the uterine vessel.
__label__2@  A side-to-side anastomosis is completed. 
__label__1@  Tensioning of the suture in between needle passes brings the mucosal edges of the urethra and bladder together.
__label__1@  he left colic artery can be isolated, branching off the main IMA trunk, and ligated separately, leaving the sigmoidal blood supply intact.
__label__1@  The balloon is then deflated and replaced with a 12-mm port for the robotic camera.
__label__1@  The external oblique muscles are separated using retractors to expose the lumbodorsal fascia.
__label__1@  The stay suture is held in arm 3 to keep the ileum pulled into the pelvis, and 20-cm is measured both proximally and distally.
__label__2@  Next step is pulmonary artery branch(es).
__label__2@  Generally, the infraumbilical position is caudal enough for the omentectomy and construction of the jejunojejunal anastomosis and close enough to the esophageal hiatus for construction of the esophagojejunostomy. 
__label__1@  The degree to which the peritoneum has been dissected off the anterior abdomen is noted for subsequent placement of ports.
__label__1@  The stoma is then matured at the functional limb using 2-0 polyglactin sutures through the distal stoma edges, including a seromuscular bite along the conduit at the level of the skin and then subcuticular at the skin.
__label__1@  The anterior portion of the cardinal ligament is carefully mobilized to “ unroof ” the ureter, and incision of the cardinal ligament medial to the ureter is done after the ureter is rolled laterally.
__label__2@  The diagnosis and treatment of benign and malignant diseases of the anterior mediastinum remains a challenge to the thoracic surgeon. 
__label__2@  Tissue irregularities could suggest extracapsular disease.
__label__1@  The distal lymphatic tissue is meticulously controlled with a series of clips for lymphostasis.
__label__1@  Pneumoperitoneum is released and all incision are closed at the skin level with subcuticular sutures and covered with bonding agent or adhesive strips.
__label__1@  This allows the assistant to provide adequate traction and suction within the single access site.
__label__2@  Two patients with biopsy-proven thymoma and convincing preoperative computed tomography (CT) evidence of extracapsular extension of disease were resected with median sternotomy. 
__label__1@  An identical node dissection is completed on the contralateral side in similar fashion (Fig.14.3).
__label__1@  Once we are ready to clip the cystic duct or artery, we exchange the hook electrocautery for the medium-large clip applier.
__label__1@  The left gastric artery is exposed at its origin as well as the coronary vein.
__label__1@  The posterior wall is reapproximated in a similar fashion as previously described, but rather than folding the anterior wall, it is simply reapproximated (Fig.14.33).
__label__1@  We do an intraoperative cholangiography or near-infrared cholangiography (optional).
__label__1@  Lymphatic tissue is similarly removed off of the hypogastric artery.
__label__1@  A footboard is placed, and the patient is carefully secured to the table.
__label__2@  If not performed carefully, serious visceral and vascular injury can occur. 
__label__1@  During the case, the tension can be adjusted as needed.
__label__1@  A suture is placed from the rectourethralis to just posterior to the enterotomy.
__label__1@  Typical postoperative care instructions include removal of dressings, bathing instructions, and routine weight-lifting restrictions.
__label__1@  After mobilization of the colon, the Gerota's fascia is opened below the lower pole of the kidney to identify the psoas muscle and the ureter that is usually running just above the muscle.
__label__1@  Patient was positioned in the right side up flank position with our standard port placement as indicated in the illustration.
__label__1@  The robot is docked to the ports, and the robotic camera is placed within the chest at a 30 downward orientation.
__label__2@  On the left side the lumbar vein could hide the exposure of the left renal artery, therefore may need to be addressed with  bipolar grasper and monopolar scissors or a vessel sealer
__label__1@  The gonadal vessels (infundibulopelvic ligament) are separated away from the ureter.
__label__1@  The fenestrated bipolar cautery can be again used to first cauterize and then transect the tissues with the monopolar scissors.
__label__2@  The utility incision  provide enough to space to introduce one robotic arm together with the instruments controlled by the bed assistant, such as sucker, sponge stick and stapler. 
__label__2@  During this step, the primary goal is separation of the prostate from the bladder.
__label__1@  One can also corkscrew the specimen through the vaginal canal.
__label__1@  The first step is then management of the' para-nephric' fat.
__label__1@  After division of the vasa, dissection proceeds around the lateral edge of the seminal vesicles, continuing toward the base of the prostate.
__label__1@  A combination of gentle blunt and sharp dissection readily allows the surgeon to completely mobilize the esophageal hiatus down to the contralateral pleura.
__label__1@  The closure is reinforced with 3-0 silk Lembert sutures, which are left long for future identification in the event of reoperation.
__label__2@  The next step is to divide the mesentery. 
__label__2@  This manoeuvre helps to pass the stapler more safely without pushing too hard.
__label__2@  Avoiding equipment malfunction is also important to a successful operation. 
__label__2@  A difference of RARP is that the visualization is superb in the deep pelvis, which assists with accurate suture placement and visual assurance of tissue apposition. 
__label__1@  We clamp the renal artery alone with laparoscopic bulldog clamps prior to tumor resection.
__label__1@  If using the Si ® system, clear a path for the patient cart to approach the patient over the right shoulder (at 45 °).
__label__2@  Failure to do so may result in inadvertent visceral injury.
__label__1@  Partial nephrectomy using the multiport robotic technique is reproduced using the SP surgical system.
__label__1@  The sigmoid colon should be mobilized to allow for adequate access to the left retroperitoneum.
__label__1@  The fourth robotic arm instrument can be used for caudal retraction of the kidney.
__label__2@  It should be a bipolar instrument, either the Maryland dissector, fenestrated bipolar, or PK dissecting instrument. 
__label__2@  Patients are discharged on days 7 to 9 and return to the clinic in approximately 3 weeks, at which time the perianastomotic drain is removed. 
__label__2@  In patients where an occult or unsuspected cancer exists (in the uterus), uterine morcellation has the potential to spread cancerous cells into the abdominal cavity and decrease survival.
__label__1@  If the take-off of the superior segment branch is too separated from the basal trunk and difficult to be isolated in one single step, the artery should be divided into two separated steps.
__label__2@  The stomal dressing is changed daily.
__label__1@  Following placement of the midline port, two 8-mm ports are placed in the left midclavicular line and left anterior axillary lines.
__label__1@  Regardless, both the radical hysterectomy and pelvic lymphadenectomy are begun by opening of the retroperitoneal space, generally by incising an avascular space in the anterior broad ligament or over the pelvic sidewall that is extended cranially and caudally parallel to the infundibulopelvic (IP) ligament
__label__1@  Care is taken to ensure that the Foley catheter and urethra are not caught in the staple line by moving the catheter in and out of the urethra freely after the stapler is clamped.
__label__1@  The patients are kept NPO on maintenance fluids for the first 24 h.
__label__2@  Three-year overall survival and disease-free survival were unchanged.
__label__2@  This places tension on the round ligament and the infundibulopelvic ligament and allows the surgeon to gain safe access to the retroperitoneal space.
__label__2@  Avoidance of sacral vessels is critical during the suturing phase of the procedure. 
__label__2@  Functional urethral length can be important for recovery of continence.
__label__2@  Self-sustaining liver retraction helps expose the hepatoduodenal and hepatogastric ligaments and provides easy access to the lesser curvature of the stomach, the celiac axis, and the esophageal crux. 
__label__1@  Place the patient cart to the left of the patient (side docking) or place it between the legs.
__label__1@  Perinephric fat is dissected to expose the renal tumor.
__label__1@  Dip the port in saline or water to facilitate ease of port placement.
__label__2@  If the correct plane is not entered, entry into the bladder, injury to the ureters, or cutting into the prostate can occur.
__label__1@  Tumor enucleoresection is performed using sharp and blunt dissection.
__label__2@  No data is yet available for its implementation in human surgery.
__label__1@  An alternative would be to place it in the right mid-abdomen.
__label__1@  The camera can also be moved to other arms/trocars on the Xi ® system and the instrument arms varied accordingly.
__label__1@  Arms 1 and 3 are placed in the left-sided ports, and arm 2 is placed in the 12-mm right-sided port.
__label__2@  There is always the possibility that one must convert to an open approach due to other factors (e.g., extensive adhesions, metastatic cancer).
__label__1@  It is often helpful to place two bulldog clamps on the renal artery if renal artery length allows.
__label__1@  An endovascular stapler is used to divide the lesser curve vasculature at a point approximating the incisura.
__label__2@  Room setup will be dependent upon the robotic platform to be used. 
__label__1@  The luminal intestine is not separated from the mesentery for an isolated staple fire.
__label__1@  In young female patients, the camera port is placed strategically in the submammary fold for improved cosmetics.
__label__2@  As a consequence, a robotically-assisted device employing the SPIDER system with the surgeon at the bedside, the SurgiBot™, was developed with the potential of an additional future platform for robotic single-site surgery. 
__label__1@  The vision tower should be positioned so that the bedside assistant has a direct line of view to the monitor.
__label__1@  A point approximately 1 to 2 centimeters above the xiphoid is marked in the midline.
__label__1@  If the contralateral pleural space was entered, a small chest tube is placed across the midline, aspirated, and removed.
__label__2@  A scissor in the medial right port is used to create a 1–2-cm enterotomy on the antimesenteric border of the ileum.
__label__1@  If using the Xi ® system, the endoscopic camera is inserted into the umbilical trocar and attached to arm 3.
__label__1@  The pedicle is then divided close to its origin with a stapler or vessel sealer.
__label__1@  After uterine arteries and uterosacral ligaments have been transected and the rectovaginal space developed, the colpotomy is made.
__label__1@  A segment of ileum is then measured to create the conduit.
__label__1@  The advantage of the fourth arm is that the kidney can be elevated using a ProGrasp, thus freeing both working robotic instruments.
__label__2@  This facilitates the dissection of tissues during robotic surgery.
__label__1@  Anterior and posterior planes are created with blunt and/or sharp dissection for a length of approximately 4–6-cm.
__label__1@  Trocar 1 is the right hand and should be a monopolar instrument of the surgeon’s choosing.
__label__2@  As with any procedure, there are variations in port placement.
__label__1@  The peritoneum overlying the seminal vesicle complex is incised deep in the pouch of Douglas.
__label__2@  There is no difference in the safety of open versus closed-entry technique to establish abdominal access. 
__label__1@  The port incisions are closed in multiple layers.
__label__2@  Trendelenburg positioning is required in order to move small bowel and portions of the sigmoid colon out of the pelvis.
__label__1@  By placing the IP ligament under tension, the ureter will be dropped away from the IP ligament, thus avoiding potential injury to the ureter.
__label__1@  The ileum is then divided, using cautery at the proximal end of the conduit.
__label__1@  The kidney graft is placed in a preperitoneal pocket.
__label__2@  When the bladder must be separated away from the uterus and cervix, the uterus should be in a neutral-to-slightly retroverted position to facilitate this dissection.
__label__1@  The two dog-ears are then closed (again, the right and then the left).
__label__1@  A body-warming device is placed on the upper body.
__label__2@  Nerve sparing can be performed in antegrade fashion from the bladder to the prostatic apex or in retrograde fashion from the prostatic apex to the bladder
__label__1@  Hemostatic agents such as Surgiflo® (Ethicon), BioGlue® (CryoLife), or Evicel® (Ethicon) can be applied as per surgeon preference.
__label__1@  The dissection is continued following the contour of the prostate while continuously assessing for tissue irregularities that could suggest extracapsular disease.
__label__1@  The incision is then closed in layers.
__label__2@  Often, the right colon may be well away from the area of dissection and may not require further mobilization.
__label__2@  Physiologic adhesions between the rectosigmoid colon and the left pelvic sidewall and adnexal tissues should be taken down.
__label__2@  This allows for en bloc retrieval of lymph node station 4 s.
__label__1@  Once again, inspection of the bladder trigone and ureteral orifices is important to identify possible ureteral injuries.
__label__1@  The right lateral 5-mm port is created for introduction of the liver retractor, which is placed under direct vision and secured with a static retraction device.
__label__1@  The stoma is then matured using 2-0 polyglactin sutures through the distal edge of the stoma, seromuscular along the conduit at the level of the skin, and then subcuticular at the skin.
__label__2@  There are many variations to port placement. 
__label__1@  Ten centimeters of the bowel in either direction from the urethral anastomosis is incised along the antimesenteric border.
__label__2@  This is usually visible to the naked eye.
__label__1@  We only use three arms of the robot.
__label__1@  Once the sutures are passed, each is tied down.
__label__1@  This port may also be used as an alternative camera entry site to improve visualization along the greater curve of the stomach during mobilization of the omentum and gastroepiploic arcade.
__label__1@  Finally, the right midclavicular 8-mm robotic port and 12-mm assistant port are placed.
__label__2@  The line should start in the right lower quadrant and progress toward the left upper quadrant in a line connecting the right femoral head to the left midclavicular line. 
__label__1@  The perivesical tissue lateral to the bladder neck is developed bluntly under direct vision until the posterior space created during seminal vesicle dissection is encountered.
__label__1@  Obvious arteries supplying the mass can be clipped with either metal clips or locking Hem-o-loc plastic clips as the tumor excision progresses.
__label__1@  Elbows should be placed forwards, so that the robotic arms do not collide with the arms.
__label__1@  The peritoneum overlying the right common iliac artery is then incised until the aortic bifurcation is exposed.
__label__1@  Intraoperative ultrasound may be used to define the margins of the tumor and its extent into the renal parenchyma.
__label__1@  Patients with clinically advanced local-regional disease (T3 and/or any N) are referred for induction chemotherapy and radiation, followed by surgical resection approximately 4 to 6 weeks after completion of treatment.
__label__1@  A Foley catheter or sound is used to identify the lumen of the urethra in order to assist with accurate urethral stitch placement.
__label__1@  A 31-cm segment of ascending colon is then measured starting at the appendix; this segment will be used to create the colonic reservoir.
__label__1@  It is grabbed with the robotic needle driver, and the tip is placed into the left ureter, using the Cadiere grasper to aid the passage.
__label__1@  The gauze can be identified during the supraduodenal dissection.
__label__1@  We prefer a wide reflection of the colon down to the iliac vessels in the pelvis, allowing for clear identification of gonadal vessels and the ureter.
__label__1@  With elevation of the bladder and cranial retraction of the uterus, the vesicouterine space is easily developed with the use of monopolar cautery and blunt dissection.
__label__1@  This dissection is continued posteriorly into the fossa of Marseille.
__label__1@  We then noted a second lesion anterior to the pulmonary artery, and a biopsy specimen was obtained with the robotic instrumentation.
__label__1@  Next, the plane funneling to the bladder neck between the base of the prostate and the bladder neck is developed with a combination of cautery and blunt dissection.
__label__1@  In the nerve-sparing patient, the posterior dissection can be performed in the plane between the two leaflets of Denonvilliers’ fascia.
__label__1@  Cloquet’s node is then dissected off the pubis and the posterior aspect of the external iliac vein.
__label__1@  The splenic flexure mobilization is performed with arm 3 on trocar 4.
__label__1@  The proximal margin is marked with a stitch and routinely sent for frozen section margin analysis.
__label__1@  The bladder is then carefully dissected away from the anterior cervix and anterior vaginal wall using cautery (Fig.14.11).
__label__1@  In cases of severe endometriosis, the posterior cul-de-sac can be obliterated.
__label__1@  Since the assist-port will be placed on the patient’s left side, the patient-side assistants will need to stand or sit on the left side of the patient, with the main assistant monitor on the opposite side facing the assistant.
__label__2@  Similar to open RP, the key principle of creating a watertight anastomosis that is not under tension is important to prevent anastomotic leak. 
__label__1@  On the right side, that includes opening up the Coronary Ligament and taking down the Triangular ligament to mobilize the liver more anterolaterally to give access to the most cranial portion on the adrenal gland.
__label__2@  Postoperative management of patients who have undergone robotic gastrectomy can follow an enhanced recovery program after surgery. 
__label__2@  Anatomic nerve sparing has been shown to improve continence and potency after surgery
__label__2@  To save time, use the Cadiere forceps in the left hand to help throw the suture, rather than putting a second needle driver in the left hand.
__label__1@  An Alexis wound retractor is then placed for aid in exposure.
__label__2@  This time point provides an excellent opportunity for the entire operative field to be examined for hemostasis.
__label__1@  Lymphatic tissue is then mobilized off of the anterior surface of the internal iliac artery.
__label__1@  Arms 1 and 2 are attached to the right lower quadrant trocars and arm 4 to the left lower quadrant trocar.
__label__2@  This is an important step, as it is very easy to mobilize underneath the retroperitoneum and kidney if the planes are not distinct. 
__label__1@  The peritoneum is then incised, and the rectovaginal space is developed as caudally as is necessary to achieve an adequate vaginal margin; this is achieved using both blunt dissection and monopolar cautery.
__label__2@  The procedure can be performed with any combination of these instruments, depending upon surgeon preference and experience, and instrument availability.
__label__2@  The da Vinci Xi® robotic system has a different setup. 
__label__2@  Removal of lymph nodes during RP is the most accurate means of lymph node staging and assessment.
__label__2@  Completed bilateral anatomic extended LND is shown in (Fig. 12.8a, b).
__label__1@  The identified jejunum is then divided with a linear stapler.
__label__2@  Hernia rates range from 2% to more than 15%, depending on patient factors such as obesity, age, and medical conditions. 
__label__1@  A laparoscopic suction instrument can be introduced through one of the previously placed assistant's ports to provide traction and suction, giving a clear view of the resection area.
__label__1@  We prefer da Vinci® EndoWrist One Vessel Sealer instrument to circumferentially ligate and divide around the adrenal lesion of interest (partial adrenalectomy) or, more frequently, the entire gland.
__label__2@  Instruments are followed from insertion at the trocar site to the position in the operative field. 
__label__1@  Hem-o-lock clips were used to secure the sutures.
__label__1@  Once the uretero-enteric anastomoses are completed, the midline incision is closed and the abdomen insufflated.
__label__1@  The peritoneum is incised on either side of the ureter sharply.
__label__1@  Vaginal manipulation is necessary to create spaces for graft fixation in the case of prior hysterectomy, whether total or supracervical.
__label__1@  It can be secured to the uterus using clips, to improve exposure of the remainder of the pelvis.
__label__1@  The suture is held close to the urethra.
__label__1@  Next, the lateral edge of the distal margin of detubularized lumen is folded down to the apex of the anterior edge of the enterotomy.
__label__1@  The Foley catheter is hand-irrigated every 4-hours and kept in place for 3-weeks.
__label__2@  In the postoperative patient with normal vital signs and a normal abdominal exam, early initiation of oral feeding is advantageous, and by the fourth postoperative day, patients may be consuming a postgastrectomy diet (multiple small meals daily). 
__label__1@  A grasper secures the ureteral, ileal, and red Robinson catheters prior to undocking the robot.
__label__1@  The camera port should be a minimum of 15-cm from the pubic symphysis.
__label__2@  Forty robotic cases were compared with 135 laparoscopic cases. 
__label__2@  Diagnostic procedures have been used principally for the evaluation of unknown masses of the anterior mediastinum and conformation of suspected hematopoietic malignancies such as lymphoma and Hodgkin’s disease. 
__label__1@  Intraoperative ultrasound imaging provides excellent visualization and measurements of both exophytic and endophytic tumor configurations.
__label__1@  It is important to have a suction-irrigator device readily available to ensure a clean surgical field and to potentially facilitate smoke evacuation.
__label__1@  The 10- and 12-mm trocar sites are closed under direct laparoscopic vision.
__label__1@  The peritoneum lateral to the sigmoid colon is incised at the line of Toldt.
__label__2@  Most of the literature for robotic colorectal surgery focuses on rectal surgery and proctectomy, but there is a growing body of literature for robotic colectomies. 
__label__2@  A uterine manipulator is frequently used in radical hysterectomies and can facilitate visualization during the procedure, as well as demarcating the vaginal margin during colpotomy.
__label__1@  Its relationship to the ureter is identified, and the two are separated.
__label__2@  SLN detection rates vary according to the dye.
__label__1@  The peritoneal incision can then be carried along the lateral border of the external iliac artery, serving as the lateral aspect of the dissection and preventing inadvertent injury to the genitofemoral nerve.
__label__1@  The mesh is then attached to the ALL using 2–3 interrupted Gore-Tex sutures.
__label__2@  Since its initial introduction, robotic-assisted thoracic surgery has undergone a continuous, and amazingly quick, evolution. 
__label__1@  At the head end, stands cannot be used to hold drapes up.
__label__1@  Intravenous mannitol may be administered to aid in osmotic diuresis.
__label__2@  The robotic instrumentation cart is set up on the patient’s right side, and the tower is set up on the left. 
__label__1@  Sequential compression devices are applied to the lower extremities.
__label__2@  The critical view of safety has three requirements: the triangle of Calot is cleared of fat and fibrous tissue; the lowest portion of the gallbladder must be separated from the cystic plate; only two structures should be seen entering the gallbladder.
__label__2@  Once the bladder is mobilized enough to drop below the pubic bone, the endopelvic fascia as well as the anterior prostatic fat should be easily visible.
__label__1@  If space does not allow for this configuration, the vision cart can be placed to the patient’s upper right, close enough for all the connecting wires to reach without tension.
__label__1@  A single-site port is placed, and the camera and two arms are used in the single-site port.
__label__2@  The standard approach for RASC utilizes general anesthesia.
__label__2@  Finally, when using the da Vinci Xi® robot, the port placement again starts in a straight line.
__label__1@  The plane is then developed laterally until the left ureter is displayed and mobilized away to avoid any possible injury.
__label__1@  This permits greater range of camera movement inferiorly within the retroperitonuem.
__label__1@  Position the remote center of the cannula at the level of the peritoneum (black band).
__label__1@  During later phases of the operation this port may be expanded to 15 mm, to allow entry of larger stapler sizes during gastric conduit formation, if needed.
__label__2@  A final stapler fire divides the conduit from the specimen. 
__label__1@  The lymphatic tissue can then be carefully dissected off of the proximal obturator nerve in the fossa of Marseille and swept distally into the pelvis.
__label__2@  In general, patients who are candidates for open abdominal sacrocolpopexy are also candidates for RASC.
__label__1@  The trocars are removed under direct vision and the specimen is retrieved.
__label__1@  It is then mobilized caudad toward the internal inguinal ring and completely excised distally.
__label__2@  Caution: Occasionally, the left gastric vein drains into the splenic vein and can course anterior to the splenic artery. 
__label__1@  When stapling the distal bowel (between the paired silk sutures), two staple loads should be used to facilitate an additional “ bite ” of mesentery to help the stoma to pass through the abdominal wall.
__label__2@  This can be accomplished while holding the umbilical tape and the bowel simultaneously, performing a hand-to-hand motion as if running the bowel.
__label__1@  Initially, the shape and size of the prostate is visually gauged, and the Foley balloon can be deflated to show where the collapsed bladder ends and the prostate begins.
__label__1@  The anterior mediastinum was evaluated and the feasibility of resection was determined.
__label__1@  Once the stapler traverses the DVC for a few centimeters, it can be closed.
__label__1@  This will ensure that the mesenteric vasculature is sufficiently secured.
__label__1@  The peritoneal incision is continued distally until the circumflex iliac vein is identified.
__label__1@  Using the fourth arm to retract the obliterated umbilical artery medially, the medial edge of the lymph node packet is developed by bluntly sweeping the tissue laterally and coursing down to the endopelvic fascia.
__label__1@  With scissors in the surgeons' right arm and a Maryland bipolar forceps in the left arm, the peritoneum is opened along Toldt's fascia in an avascular plane.
__label__1@  The lateral and posterior pedicles are then bluntly separated.
__label__2@  In transperitoneal RARP, extended pelvic lymph node dissection (see Section “Pelvic Lymph Node Dissection”) can be performed next; otherwise the operation proceeds with the development of the space of Retzius in patients at low risk for nodal metastases.
__label__1@  A gastrotomy is performed at the most proximal portion of the conduit, and carefully held open with the assistance of robotic retraction and the bedside assistant.
__label__2@  Through the open urethra, the transected catheter is delivered into the pelvis and used for traction.
__label__1@  Divide the gastrocolic ligament to enter the lesser sac.
__label__1@  Trocar 3 can be placed extremely lateral in the anterior axillary line on the left, offset from trocar 2.
__label__1@  Next, Gerota's fascia is incised just above the psoas muscle exposing the perinephric fat and kidney.
__label__1@  The conduit is secured to the fascia at four locations using a 0 polyglactin suture through a seromuscular layer of the conduit.
__label__1@  The permanent cautery hook is then placed at the utility incision port (surgeon right hand: arm 1), and the fenestrated bipolar forceps is finally introduced operative port (surgeon right hand; arm 2).
__label__2@  The anterior portion of the ureteral anastomosis is completed with the previously placed suture.
__label__2@  Care must be taken to follow the trocar with the camera at all times, to avoid unintended visceral injury. 
__label__1@  Further anterior dissection may be performed if needed after the hysterectomy with the aid of a vaginal manipulator.
__label__1@  The assistant should use a bowel grasper for retraction and the suction irrigator when necessary.
__label__1@  If the dissection is too deep into the lobe, it may lead to isolation and division of only a few branches rather than the whole vein.
__label__1@  We prefer to complete vascular dissection before dividing blood vessels.
__label__2@  Though the esophagojejunostomy can be created with either linear or circular staples, we prefer the use of a transoral anvil (Orvil™, Covidien, New Haven, CT).
__label__2@  This completes the procedure of robotic D2 lymphadenectomy for distal subtotal gastrectomy.
__label__2@  Once these three requirements are met, the “critical view of safety” has been obtained.
__label__1@  The greater omentum of the stomach is dissected from the transverse colon, exposing the posterior wall of the stomach and opening the lesser sac.
__label__1@  Two small enterotomies are made in each limb of the bowel, and two firings of the robotic stapler are used to create the anastomosis.
__label__1@  Specimen extraction through a Pfannenstiel incision would require a suprapubic port.
__label__1@  Also it could be used to confirm ischemia, and in cases of selective clamping.
__label__1@  In the medial right hand, the needle driver is exchanged with a scissor.
__label__1@  Following renorrhaphy, insufflation pressure is reduced to 5 mm Hg for 5e10 min to evaluate for surgical bleeding.
__label__1@  Excessive mediastinal dissection should be minimized at this time to avoid entry into the pleural spaces, which may cause hemodynamic compromise and loss of intraperitoneal CO2 insufflation.
__label__1@  Alternatively, a 5-mm laparoscopic instrument can be utilized through a 5-mm right upper quadrant trocar in place of instrument arm 3 (or arm 1 with the Xi ® system).
__label__1@  Two 8-mm robotic ports are placed with at least a 7 cm space between each port along the lateral edge of the rectus on each side of the camera port.
__label__1@  The two ureters are stented with single-J urinary diversion stents that are brought out through a 1-mm incision in the distal afferent limb of the neobladder and placed beside the right robotic port site.
__label__2@  Patients should also be strapped to the table at the level of the shoulders, to prevent sliding when in deep Trendelenburg.
__label__1@  To dock the robot, the patient should be placed in steep Trendelenburg with the operating table as low as possible.
__label__2@  One patient with biopsyproven thymoma and questionable preoperative evidence of extracapsular extension underwent an initial right videoscopic evaluation and subsequent resection through a median sternotomy. 
__label__1@  A cauterizing loop and Endo Catch bag are used.
__label__1@  The lymph node dissection is carried cephalad from the bifurcation of the right common iliac artery to the level of the renal hilum.
__label__1@  Perforating vessels can be easily identified and ligated using bipolar cautery.
__label__1@  A mobile piece of jejunum 30–40-cm downstream of the ligament of Treitz is identified, making sure it will reach to the esophageal hiatus and the divided end of the distal esophagus.
__label__1@  The colonic mesentery is then divided, staying medial and travelling superiorly to the distal transverse colon, taking care to identify and ligate a variable right colon artery and the right branch of the middle colic artery.
__label__1@  The thymus is then placed in an endoscopic bag and removed through the lower port.
__label__1@  The most dependent portion of the ileum that will easily reach to the level of the urethra is identified and marked with a stay suture.
__label__2@  We had a fair experience with robotic-assisted cardiac and thoracic surgery when a patient was referred with an anterior mediastinal mass. 
__label__1@  Clear the vessels from the surrounding soft tissue, ligate them with Hem-o-lok ® clips (Teleflex; Wayne, PA), and divide the vessels leaving one Hem-o-lok ® clip on the patient side.
__label__1@  Tape is placed across the chest and hip and the patient secured with straps.
__label__1@  Using the integrated nearinfrared endoscopic visualization system in either robotic multiport or single-site cholecystectomy, real-time visualization of the biliary anatomy can occur.
__label__1@  Both structures are ligated and transected.
__label__1@  The bladder should be well cleared from this junction by about 1–1.5-cm to avoid developing a vesicovaginal fistula.
__label__1@  If necessary, however, the laparoscopic incisions can be closed, the tape removed, and the abdomen re-prepared for surgery (antiseptic wash and draping).
__label__1@  The renorrhaphy was performed in two layers, utilizing a 2-0 and 0 polyfilament suture for the inner and outer layers, respectively.
__label__1@  The gastric tube is constructed with multiple fires of the Endo gastrointestinal stapler, introduced through the 12-mm assistant port, with careful 214 Sarkaria & Rizk attention paid to proper orientation of the evolving conduit at all times.
__label__2@  This will ensure that the mesenteric vasculature is sufficiently secured.
__label__1@  One should be able to feel the tip of the 12th rib, the psoas muscle and sometimes the lower pole of the kidney.
__label__1@  The urethral aperture is then created sharply or with cautery using the cutting current.
__label__1@  Once the pouch is created and the continence mechanism is completed, we proceed with the ureteral anastomoses.
__label__1@  Gentle blunt dissection along the crus exposes the posterolateral esophagus.
__label__1@  A kidney-shaped balloon dissector is then placed into the retroperitoneal space.
__label__1@  The patient should be positioned in dorsal lithotomy, with arms tucked at her sides, with careful attention paid to protecting the hands from inadvertent injury under the sterile drapes.
__label__1@  In case a stapler device is used, the serosa should be approximated with seromuscular stitches.
__label__2@  The median hospital stay was 2 days (range 1 to 4 days). 
__label__1@  This incision is continued around the appendix; The mesoappendix is then divided using the LigaSure device or serial 3-0 silk suture ligations.
__label__1@  Next, an enterotomy is created 20-cm proximal to the urethral anastomosis.
__label__2@  Also in high-risk disease or in patients with large median lobes or asymmetric prostates, determining the exact plane between prostate and bladder can be challenging.
__label__2@  Hasson and direct insertion techniques may be used to gain access to the peritoneal cavity with equivalent safety.
__label__1@  If using the double-docking technique, the robot should first be docked from the left, about 15 degrees from the left shoulder.
__label__2@  Moreover, with the recent addition of robotic staplers, the anastomoses can be performed using the robotic instruments.
__label__2@  Resection was accomplished by either a standard median sternotomy or with robotic-assisted techniques. 
__label__1@  The gastrohepatic omentum is now further incised up to the level of the esophageal hiatus with the energy sealant device.
__label__1@  Using a small retractor, gently place the port into the abdomen.
__label__2@  Finally, the da Vinci Xi® system should be able to reach the splenic flexure with some minor alteration of the flex joints. 
__label__1@  Once the specimen is secured, the robotic instruments are removed and the arms are undocked.
__label__1@  A GIA stapler is then used to staple and divide the terminal ileum approximately 15-cm proximal to the ileocecal valve.
__label__1@  The external iliac vessels are gently retracted laterally to dissect the lymphatic tissue posterior to the vessels.
__label__1@  Once the posterior wall is complete, the lateral edges of the bowel closest to the urethral margin are closed in a running fashion for approximately 10-cm (Fig.14.29).
__label__1@  The camera is inserted first, using the infraumbilical port.
__label__1@  After insufflation, direct insertion of a trocar is then performed.
__label__1@  The incision site is closed layer-by-layer, followed by application of topical skin adhesive.
__label__2@  There may be some potential benefit to preventing vaginal cuff dehiscence, but additional studies are needed to support this.
__label__1@  The paravesical space is opened next.
__label__2@  No long-term follow-up data have been published comparing laparoscopic approaches with open approaches. 
__label__1@  The two layers of the omentum should be incised off the transverse colon until entrance into the lesser sac has been accomplished.
__label__2@  Usually, there is one large branch or two smaller branches. 
__label__1@  The fat pad adhered to the periphery of the incision field, and the hemostatic matrix was " cooked " and closed off underneath.
__label__1@  This can be done either superficially and 1-cm deep into the stroma at the 3–9 o’clock positions, or superficially into the four quadrants of the cervix.
__label__1@  Care is also taken to preemptively identify the left renal artery prior to ligation of lateral lumbar arteries.
__label__2@  The stapler is directed toward the root of the mesentery, not at an angle, with careful attention paid to mesenteric vascular arcades, to avoid devascularization (Fig. 14.23).
__label__2@  The feeding jejunostomy is removed if the patient is tolerating a soft diet.
__label__1@  The ileal loop is placed into the pelvis.
__label__1@  No hemostatic agents are used during the renorraphy as several series, including ours, have shown no benefits in terms of hemorrhagic complications while increasing the cost of the surgical procedure.
__label__2@  There have been recent concerns about uterine morcellation to facilitate removal of the tissues from the body.
__label__1@  The thymic bed is inspected for homeostasis and completeness of resection.
__label__1@  A left lateral subcostal 5-mm incision is marked for use by the robotic atraumatic grasper.
__label__1@  In the selective renal artery non-clamping patients, a harmonic scalpel was used to remove the tumor, leaving 1-cm safety margin.
__label__1@  The accessory port may be placed in either the left upper quadrant or in the suprapubic region.
__label__2@  Near-infrared cholangiography is well documented in single-site cholecystectomy.
__label__1@  These prostate pedicles can be controlled with plastic or metallic clips.
__label__1@  Confirm the proximal resection line from the greater curvature to the lesser curvature, and divide using a stapler (either Endo-GIA ™ or robotic).
__label__1@  To insert the Single-Site ® port, a transumbilical incision 2–2.5-cm in length is performed and carried down to the midline fascia.
__label__1@  If the left phrenic nerve cannot be identified, the left pleural space is entered and the scope passed across the midline into the left chest.
__label__1@  The Roux limb is now prepared for the esophagojejunostomy.
__label__2@  This allows access to the abdomen, pelvis, and vagina during the procedure.
__label__1@  The common channel defect is then closed with robotic suturing in two layers.
__label__2@  it is delineated by the obliterated umbilical artery medially, the pubic symphysis anteriorly, the cardinal ligament posteriorly, and the external iliac vessels laterally.
__label__1@  Both prophylactic doses of subcutaneous heparin as well as compression stockings should be applied immediately postoperatively.
__label__1@  The operating surgeon and surgical trainee are positioned at the robotic consoles, and an assisting surgeon remains at the bedside.
__label__1@  The incisions are then closed.
__label__2@  During RARP the pneumoperitoneum, especially if temporarily increased, may reduce active bleeding during this step of the operation.
__label__2@  If another articulating instrument is used instead of the ultrasonic shears, such as the hot shears or vessel sealer, then the placement of the right-sided port can be more forgiving. 
__label__2@  This dissection also aids in setting up the prostate pedicles and preservation of neurovascular bundles.
__label__2@  As with a right colon resection, port placement depends on surgeon preference and the model of the robot.  
__label__2@  The entire dissection should be completed athermally and with minimal traction on the neurovascular bundle, to avoid long-standing postoperative neurapraxia.
__label__1@  The inferior mesenteric artery (IMA) pedicle is tented up, and a plane is developed underneath the pedicle just superior to the sacral promontory.
__label__1@  The fat pad covering should be accomplished within 20s to prevent solidifying of the fibrin sealant.
__label__2@  This creates dog-ears of equal length, which can then be closed in a running fashion, first the right and then the left.
__label__1@  The patient is placed in the full flank position and the table fully flexed to increase the space between the 12th rib and iliac crest.
__label__1@  It will help to gently retract the parenchyma that can be easily torn, particularly in the presence of giant bullous emphysema.
__label__1@  A 6-cm midline incision is then made just below the umbilicus, and the rectus fascia and peritoneum are opened.
__label__1@  Clips are applied to the cisterna chyli, which is located just posterior to the right renal artery.
__label__1@  Once the wall is complete, the suture is tied to itself.
__label__1@  The vas deferens is divided laterally, and the dissection continues around the tip and lateral border of the seminal vesicles up toward the base of the prostate.
__label__2@  The length of the anterior dissection should not exceed the total vaginal length minus the urethral length.
__label__1@  Instruments consist of non-wristed, flexible-shaft instruments that fit through the curved cannulae.
__label__1@  Initial dissection is begun by opening the lesser sac and dissecting free the esophageal hiatus.
__label__2@  Preoperative imaging with computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), or ultrasound can provide information about the volume and shape of the prostate as well as the presence of asymmetric lobes or an enlarged median lobe.
__label__2@  Robotic surgery requires coordinated teamwork within the operating room, with all team members having familiarity not only with the procedure being performed but also with robotic surgery.
__label__1@  Then the lateral edge of the distal ileal edge is secured to the lateral edge of the opposite lateral edge, 7–10-cm proximal to the urethral anastomosis (Fig.14.31).
__label__1@  Only two gel rolls are placed to support the back of the patient who is placed in a modified flank position with a 30 ° angle and secured to the table with two adhesive cloth tapes applied above the pelvis and chest.
__label__1@  Care must be taken when isolating the lower lobe vein.
__label__1@  A Keith needle with a 30-cm-long, 2-0 silk suture attached is passed through the abdominal wall 2-cm inferior to the medial right-hand port.
__label__1@  After positioning, the table is rotated, so that the patient side-cart can be docked straight over the patient’s head.
__label__1@  The ureter and lower pole can be retracted upward and laterally, and traced back to the renal hilum.
__label__1@  Finally, arm 3 is for retraction.
__label__2@  When the oblique fissure between the middle and lower lobe is relatively complete, then it is possible to identify the artery in the fissure quite quickly. 
__label__2@  Therapeutic resections have been primarily applied to patients with thymoma, myasthenia gravis, and thymic or bronchogenic cysts.
__label__1@  The lymphatic tissue is dissected off of the obturator vessels and nerve, paying close attention to minimize the use of monopolar cautery around the obturator nerve.
__label__2@  A general preoperative clearance is also necessary, with a cardiac work-up when indicated. 
__label__1@  A balloon dilator was used to create the retroperitoneal space, which was entered via the exposed thoracolumbar fascia, irrespective of their location.
__label__1@  Place the patient cart between the legs.
__label__1@  Renal artery and vein were clamped with bulldogs.
__label__1@  To begin, a grasping instrument (Cadiere or crocodile forceps) is attached to instrument arm 1, and a monopolar cautery hook or Maryland grasper is attached to instrument arm 2.
__label__2@  The left ureter is not passed under the sigmoid colon, but is anastomosed to the left limb, and the right ureter is anastomosed to the right limb (Fig. 14.34).
__label__1@  Once the LGA has been divided, continue the skeletonization, and retrieve the soft tissues off the anterior surface of the splenic artery until approximately half of the distance of the splenic artery has been cleared.
__label__1@  Gentle, blunt separation with the elbows of the instruments will help to find the correct plane.
__label__1@  The specimen is removed and evaluated by frozen section to assess margins.
__label__1@  The specimen is placed in a laparoscopic retrieval bag, which is extracted through the single-site incision.
__label__2@  Posterior or anterior tennis racket closure with sutures in the midline posterior and anterior bladder away from the trigone can reduce the size of the bladder neck.
__label__1@  A frozen-section pathologic analysis of the distal ureter can be performed to evaluate for carcinoma at the ureteral margin.
__label__1@  Catheterization is then performed again to ensure ease; The stoma is secured to the skin using interrupted 3-0 polyglactin sutures, full thickness through the stoma and subcuticular at the skin.
__label__2@  Using the integrated nearinfrared endoscopic visualization system in either robotic multiport or single-site cholecystectomy, real-time visualization of the biliary anatomy can occur. 
__label__1@  The specimen can then be tucked away above the liver or in the pelvis for later extraction.
__label__1@  The abdomen is desufflated and the gel port is removed; The Alexis wound retractor is kept in place for exposure.
__label__2@  One reason is that despite the articulation of most of the instruments, the ultrasonic shears—a very useful instrument in the lymphadenectomy portion of the procedure—do not articulate, so proper port placement for the dissection using the ultrasonic shears is important. 
__label__1@  Pillows or blankets are placed in between the arms, which are then secured together with tape.
__label__2@  There should be a low threshold for conversion from a robotic approach to an open approach based on the clinical experience and judgment of the operation surgeon. 
__label__2@  During the preoperative timeout, the entire operative team discusses the protocol for converting the operative approach and should clarify roles during the conversion.
__label__1@  The assistant port is replaced with a 10-mm port to allow the introduction of an endoscopic retrieval bag.
__label__1@  Each pole is grasped and dissected in its entirety.
__label__1@  The uterine artery is identified next and traced back toward its origin from the internal iliac artery.
__label__2@  The choice of entry should be directed by the surgeon’s training and skill and patient characteristics. 
__label__1@  The thymus is then retracted rightward, and with rotation of the scope caudally and towards the left chest, the left phrenic nerve can generally be identified.
__label__1@  A 20-mm para-umbilicus incision is made to insert the 12-mm assistant port.
__label__1@  The colon is then stapled and divided at this location using a GIA stapler (Fig.14.18).
__label__1@  Orientation of the pylorus is maintained by gentle traction on the stitches by both the right robotic arm and the bedside assistant.
__label__1@  The ureter is identified where it crosses over the common iliac artery.
__label__1@  For the thoracic phase, an insufflation needle with a saline-filled open syringe is placed into the chest, with water entry confirming safe intrapleural position.
__label__1@  An additional right lateral 5-mm subcostal port for placement of the liver retractor is marked, as well as an additional 8-mm midclavicular right midabdominal port for use with the bipolar atraumatic grasper.
__label__1@  They are ligated and divided at this time, using either clips, LigaSure bipolar cautery or the robotic vessel sealer device.
__label__2@  Risk stratification by nomograms, MRI, and clinical staging can be used to determine the extent of nerve sparing for the individual patient.
__label__2@  This study aims to describe, in easy to follow, sequential steps, the four arms robotic approach, to perform right lower and middle lobectomy. 
__label__1@  The fascia and skin are then closed at the midline incision and all remaining port sites (Fig.14.20).
__label__1@  The lateral robotic port is inserted first, measured 7–8 cm superior and lateral to the camera port.
__label__2@  The drain is removed when the output is less than 400 mL/24 h.
__label__1@  The anterior longitudinal ligament is then identified and carefully exposed.
__label__1@  A 0 polyglactin suture is then placed at the 6 and 12 o’clock positions of the anticipated urethra-neovesical anastomosis site.
__label__1@  The specimen was placed in an endocatch bag prior to closure.
__label__1@  For the thoracic phase, the patient is placed in flexion in standard left lateral decubitus position, with the right side up and the upper arm in a neutral position.
__label__1@  When opened, the incision is followed toward the puboprostatic ligaments.
__label__1@  The divided colon is extracorporealized and the proximal resection site identified.
__label__1@  The hilar clamping is limited to the artery as some suggested that it might lessen renal ischemic damage and because we feel, despite this is highly subjective, it might decrease blood loss by allowing venous blood drainage during the tumor resection.
__label__2@  The sutures should be placed in close enough proximity to create a watertight closure.
__label__1@  The renal parenchyma was sharply incised along the previously demarcated scored lines.
__label__2@  The Wiklund neobladder described by Jonsson et al. [5] uses a similar approach to the previous neobladder with a slight modification in the detubularization process.
__label__1@  After mobilization of the ascending colon dissection of the renal hilum was carried out.
__label__1@  We typically cauterizesequentially with bipolar cautery and then partially transect the IP pedicle using a combination of the scissors and electrocautery with the monopolar scissors.
__label__1@  This is followed by cauterization and transection of the superficial uterine vein.
__label__1@  A single renal vein and artery were identified.
__label__2@  This setup is ideal for the hybrid approach or if minimal splenic flexure work is needed. 
__label__1@  An esophagogram is performed on removal of the nasogastric tubes to assess for leak.
__label__1@  The dissection is continued with blunt and sharp dissection in this plane distally to the apex of the prostate and laterally out to the neurovascular bundles.
__label__2@  In general, trocars are inserted further from the target anatomy than in standard laparoscopy because of the robotic instrument length and the need to position th robotic arms.
__label__2@  It continues to gain popularity among gynecologic oncologists due to the improved dexterity and superior visualization it provides to the surgeon and the improved perioperative outcomes for patients compared to laparotomy.
__label__1@  Before the patient is prepped, the bed is briefly tested in steep reverse Trendelenburg position to confirm the stability of the patient on the table.
__label__1@  Pneumoperitoneum is established either near the umbilicus (where a 10–12-mm port will be placed), at another trocar site, or with a Veress needle in the left upper quadrant.
__label__1@  Before beginning the dissection, the left lobe of the liver can easily be retracted using any of several described techniques, including the suture-gauze liver suspension method.
__label__1@  Gerota's fascia was incised and the kidney was dissected posteriorly.
__label__2@  Relative contraindications to robotic gastrectomy may include patients with significant intraabdominal adhesions, diffuse histology, large tumor size or invasion into adjacent organs, and lack of institutional support.
__label__1@  The ileum is then brought back into continuity.
__label__1@  The posterior vaginal wall is incised just distal to the cervix, using cautery.
__label__2@  Patients who have had multiple abdominal operations are most likely not a great match for robotics. 
__label__2@  Anatomic studies reveal that the disc is most often located at the maximal anterior deflection of the promontory. 
__label__1@  Dissection is begun along the superior border of the pancreas and splenic artery, posteriorly to the retroperitoneal planes, superiorly to the hiatus, and medially to the right partway along the common hepatic artery and then superiorly toward the hiatus.
__label__1@  The right vascular pedicle to the prostate is clipped and divided using permanent Weck ® clips or absorbable Lapra clips.
__label__2@  Fourth step is Pyloroplasty.
__label__2@  If there is any difficulty in advancing the conduit, consideration should be given to performing this maneuver with standard laparoscopic instruments from the bedside to avoid unrecognized tension and injury to the gastric wall or vascular supply. 
__label__1@  The lateral-to-medial mobilization follows.
__label__1@  Surgical clips placed through the assistant port are used liberally to seal lymphatic perforators.
__label__1@  For tumors in the hepatic flexure and distal transverse colon, an extended right colectomy is necessary, with a larger mobilization of the transverse colon and division of the entire middle colic artery.
__label__1@  A shortened Penrose drain can be used to encircle the ureter and allow for ease of manipulation of the ureter.
__label__2@  Nerve sparing can be variably performed depending on preoperative cancer risk and stratification, patient age, and preoperative functional status.
__label__2@  The same principles of instrument knot-tying that are utilized during open surgery apply to the robotic instruments as well.
__label__1@  If a replaced left hepatic artery is encountered, it is clipped temporarily.
__label__2@  As more surgeons have adopted robotic surgery into their colorectal practices, the long-term and short-term outcomes are starting to be reported. 
__label__1@  To widen the area of access for the assistant's instruments, additional 10-mm ports are placed.
__label__1@  For the camera port we prefer a long port with balloon to prevent arm conflict and port expulsion.
__label__1@  Attention is next turned to the greater curve of the stomach, and the termination of the gastroepiploic arcade is identified.
__label__1@  It is critical to ensure that the assistant is also placing gentle pressure on the uterine manipulator in a cephalad direction.
__label__2@  As the dissection nears the lower pole of the spleen, the left gastroepiploic vessels arising from the splenic vessels can be identified. 
__label__2@  This fundamental principle is necessary for hysterectomy with concomitant pelvic floor repair to easily perform extirpation of the uterus, creation of the bladder flap, and amputation of the uterus above the cervix or creation of the vaginal cuff.
__label__1@  With large lesions, and especially thymomas, care must be used when removing the specimen, and occasionally, the port incision has to be extended.
__label__1@  As in conventional multiport robot-assisted partial nephrectomy, the patient is placed in a semilateral position.
__label__1@  An additional suture from the plate to the midline posterior bladder can reduce tension between the urethra and bladder.
__label__1@  Next, the musculofascial plate of the rectourethralis is approximated to the posterior neobladder, approximately 2-cm posterior to the planned urethral aperture, using 3-0 polyglactin suture.
__label__1@  A liver retractor is also frequently placed in the left upper quadrant via a small subxiphoid stab incision.
__label__1@  The detubularized segment is then placed in a U-shaped configuration and the medial edges are sewn together using continuous 3-0 polyglactin sutures.
__label__2@  Identification of the right ureter as it courses along the bifurcation of the right common iliac artery serves as the lateral and caudal margin of dissection, as can be seen in (Fig. 15.5).
__label__2@  Trocars should be the standard 8-mm robotic trocars except for the right lower quadrant trocar, which should be 12 cm to accommodate the stapler. 
__label__2@  In up to 30% of patients, an accessory pudendal artery can be encountered during this dissection; its preservation may assist with erectile function recovery.
__label__2@  The surgeon should initially operate on patients without significant medical comorbidities, with small tumors, and with normal BMI and intestinal histology.
__label__1@  After completion of the extended pelvic lymph node dissection, the uterus is retracted anteriorly using the robotic fourth arm.
__label__1@  In the lower port, the assistant passes a laparoscopic needle driver and secures the suture of the specimen bags.
__label__1@  With the tumor freed from the kidney, attention was turned to the closure of the defect.
__label__1@  The thoracic duct is ligated at the esophageal hiatus.
__label__1@  This reaction occurred soon after removing the bulldog clamp.
__label__1@  To do a counter traction for facilitating this previous step.
__label__1@  A 30-degree telescope was used and the robotic instruments were introduced through the third and seventh intercostals space in the anterior axillary line.
__label__1@  Traditionally, Weck® Hem-o-lok® clips or Endo GIA stapler has been utilized to ligate the adrenal vasculature.
__label__1@  We typically use the fenestrated bipolar cautery to accomplish ligation of the uterine vessels.
__label__1@  Vaginal cuff closure can be performed by various techniques.
__label__2@  Robotic surgery is an oncologically sound minimally invasive surgical option for patients who require distal subtotal gastrectomy with D2 lymphadenectomy. 
__label__1@  Once docked, the robotic instruments are inserted (right arm, monopolar scissors; left arm, fenestrated bipolar grasper), and the assistant assesses access to the kidney via the 12-mm port.
__label__2@  In the case of a large median lobe, the posterolateral plane can be developed around the median lobe and the bladder neck can still be preserved.
__label__2@  The advantages of the robotic system make it ideal for use in more complicated dissections, and, as such, the need for extended lateral dissection is not in and of itself an indication for laparotomy.
__label__1@  The peritoneum along the anterior cervix is incised with cautery.
__label__1@  The table will need to be tilted toward the patient’s left side and should be in Trendelenburg position, allowing the small bowel to fall into the left upper quadrant.
__label__1@  Once the renal vein and artery are found, they are dissected to the extent that a window superior and inferior to each of them is created that can easily accommodate one or two laparoscopic vascular bulldog clamps.
__label__1@  Trocars 1 and 2 are placed in the lower quadrants on either side.
__label__1@  After that, the lower lobe should be retracted with the Cadiere forceps (arm 3) and pulled towards the apex, exposing of the inferior pulmonary ligament.
__label__1@  This additional arm can be used to elevate the liver when exposing the hilum and upper pole of the right kidney making an additional port for liver traction unnecessary and thereby providing true single-site surgery even when operating on right kidneys.
__label__1@  The ileum is then divided using cautery at the proximal end of the afferent limb of the neobladder.
__label__2@  Surgeons have successfully applied robotic gastrectomy for early and advanced stage diseases and in elderly and obese gastric cancer patients. 
__label__1@  We begin RASC after completing the total hysterectomy or oversewing the cervical stump after supracervical hysterectomy.
__label__2@  If lateral, the tension that is holding the bowel to the abdominal wall often must be released to allow access to the anastomosis.
__label__1@  A soft vaginal retractor is best removed at this stage while visualizing the mesh in case vaginal wall sutures were placed transmurally into the retractor.
__label__1@  To trim any corners that may oppose the great vessels, sigmoid colon, and/or the right ureter.
__label__1@  Trocar 2 is for the left hand.
__label__1@  The anterior prostatic fat pad is then mobilized off of the anterior surface of the prostate to aid in exposure.
__label__1@  The paracaval lymph node packet is dissected off the IVC laterally where the lumbar vessels and sympathetic branches coursing medially are identified prospectively.
__label__1@  Next, the medial border of the dissection is identified as the lateral edge of the obliterated umbilical artery, over which the peritoneum is initially incised to identify the proximal margin of the dissection.
__label__1@  On the right side of the abdomen, a 10–12-mm port is placed in the midclavicular line, and a 5-mm port is placed in the anterior axillary line.
__label__1@  Moreover, in the case of uncontrolled bleeding can be converted rapidly to lateral thoracotomy.
__label__1@  During this dissection, the left gastric artery and vein are identified at the celiac axis.
__label__2@  The posterior limit of dissection is the posterior obturator fossa and presciatic fat pad.
__label__1@  The uterus, ovaries, fallopian tubes, cervix, anterior vaginal wall, bladder, and urethra are then placed en bloc in a specimen retrieval bag.
__label__1@  We commonly employ a closed-entry technique using either a Veress needle inserted in the left upper quadrant or an optical trocar inserted at the umbilicus.
__label__1@  A robotic sigmoid colon resection is performed in much the same way as the more practiced robotic low anterior resection.
__label__2@  For leftsided tumors, a standard dissection includes the para-aortic and preaortic lymph nodes, as well as interaortocaval nodes for an ELND.
__label__1@  An on-clamp approach is always used because there is currently no evidence that limited ischemia time performs worse than' zero ischemia' techniques.
__label__1@  The ureter must not be skeletonized and just needs to be spotted and gently sweeped anteriorly following the psoas muscle up to the renal hilum.
__label__2@  Visualization of these vessels is greatly facilitated by the optics on the robotic machine.
__label__1@  In an abdominal approach, Pean clamps placed along the cornu region of the uterus are used to achieve this similar positioning.
__label__1@  Using gentle blunt finger dissection, the peritoneum is carefully swept away.
__label__2@  This allows for the stomach to be retracted more left laterally as its attachments to the celiac axis help isolate the left gastric artery. 
__label__1@  The ureter is then dissected away from the common iliac artery.
__label__1@  Reposition the third arm by grasping the posterior stomach near the pylorus and retracting upward toward the liver.
__label__1@  If SLNs are not to be assessed, the lymphadenectomy may be done either before or after the radical hysterectomy.
__label__1@  The objective is to provide proper exposure of the tumor.
__label__1@  The anastomosis is then completed.
__label__1@  The internal iliac vein can be identified in this location, and care should be taken to avoid an injury here.
__label__1@  To fix the pannus to the thigh.
__label__2@  The robotic instrumentation facilitates suturing.
__label__1@  For the paracaval lymph node dissection, the procedure begins with reflection of the right colon medially along the avascular white line of Toldt, achieving elevation of the root of the mesentery and kocherization of the duodenum to expose the great vessels up to the renal hila.
__label__1@  The catheter is then removed and replaced, ensuring ease of catheterization.
__label__2@  This is especially true in men with a large amount of intraabdominal adiposity. 
__label__1@  The oblique fissure (right middle and lower lobe fissure) is often complete; if the fissure is incomplete, we divide it introducing the stapler from the utility incision after identifying the pulmonary artery.
__label__1@  When the appropriate point is selected, the ureter is held up toward the abdominal wall on tension.
__label__2@  Next phase is Lymph node dissection.
__label__1@  The short gastric arteries are divided using the ultrasonic shears, with careful dissection of the gastrosplenic attachments and completion of the left crural mobilization.
__label__1@  A fourth arm can also be used especially in cases where perinephric fat is abundant.
__label__2@  Second step is Retrogastric Dissection.
__label__2@  Finally, short-term complications and return of bowel function were better when using robotic surgery.
__label__1@  The node of Cloquet is then clipped and used as a handle to dissect beneath the external iliac vein and in the obturator fossae.
__label__1@  The inferior vena cava (IVC) is identified as the fibrofatty tissue over the IVC is divided in a split-and-roll fashion.
__label__1@  With a sponge stick introduced by the bedassistant through the utility incision, the diaphragm dome is pushed down to improve visualization of the target area.

__label__2@  The lateral limit of dissection is the genitofemoral nerve.
__label__1@  The ureter is then mobilized proximally for a short distance.
__label__1@  First, insert the camera port approximately 16–20-cm inferior to the xiphoid process (usually, just infraumbilical or just supraumbilical).
__label__1@  The lesser sac is then again entered through the greater omentum.
__label__2@  Although robotic approaches to these operations have been described, the published experience with robotic-assisted minimally invasive esophagectomy (RAMIE) remains small. 
__label__2@  The robotic technique offers significant advantage over an open approach to hysterectomy.
__label__1@  The fascia at the 12-mm robotic port sites are closed, and the skin is closed at all incisions.
__label__1@  The soft tissues surrounding the left gastric artery (LGA) are retrieved as lymph node station number 7, and the tissues along the splenic artery are retrieved as station 11p.
__label__1@  This can be done with a single Vicryl suture passed through the proximal bowel, close to the staple line, and then to the psoas muscle just above the common iliac artery.
__label__2@  Thymic disease predominated (16 patients); 6 patients had a thymoma without myasthenia gravis. 
__label__1@  Staging is performed by means of computed tomography scanning of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis; endoscopic ultrasonography; and fluorodeoxyglucose-18 positron emission tomography scanning.
__label__1@  Once the posterior plane is sufficiently created, the anterior surface of the ampulla of the vas deferens and seminal vesicles is dissected in order to clearly visualize the anatomic boundaries of the seminal vesicles.

__label__1@  A midclavicular 8-mm incision no more than 13 to 15 centimeters from the supraxiphoid reference point is marked in the left midabdomen.
__label__1@  The key is the dissect around the adrenal gland to maximize it's visual exposure before dissecting the adrenal gland free.
__label__1@  Final patient positioning must be achieved prior to docking the robot, as any change in position cannot occur with the robotic arms in place.
__label__1@  A 24-Fr Foley catheter is brought into the abdomen through the right upper quadrant port site, or a separate 1-cm incision if the port site is too cranial.
__label__2@  When performing a bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy by robotic approach, the technical aspects do not change. 
__label__1@  The scope then can be used to look down and back while ventilation is temporarily interrupted so that the exact position of the left phrenic nerve may be verified.

__label__1@  Two separate 4-0 Monocryl sutures (some prefer Vicryl) on an RB-1 needle are brought into the abdomen.
__label__2@  Routine radiologic evaluation of the esophagojejunal anastomosis is not indicated, but changes in vital signs, tachycardia, or another clinical suspicion of an esophagojejunal leak warrants either a contrast-enhanced CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis or an esophagogram with water-soluble contrast.
__label__2@  At the present time, single-site cholecystectomy is available only with the Si® model, but additional platforms are being developed for the Xi® with expansion of the application of the Sp single-port system (cleared by the FDA in 2014), which includes an articulating 3D HD camera and three fully articulating instruments through a single 25-mm cannula.
__label__1@  The right gastroepiploic vessels are identified at the superior border of the pancreas and dissected circumferentially at their origin from the gastroduodenal vessels.

__label__2@  The steps in a robotically-assisted radical hysterectomy are the same as in a radical hysterectomy performed with conventional laparoscopic equipment or an open incision.
__label__1@  The mesenteric trap is then closed using a 3-0 polyglactin suture in continuous fashion.
__label__1@  A variety of dyes may be used, including both colorimetric (methylene blue and isosulfan blue) and immunofluorescent (indocyanine green).

__label__1@  On the right side, the second portion of the duodenum is carefully Kocherized to expose the IVC.
__label__1@  Alternatively, the sutures can be placed after the excision takes place if the surgeon feels that the suture may get in the way while extirpating the lesion.
__label__1@  After the creation of this pocket, the iliac vessels and bladder are prepared and the kidney is transplanted using the classical technique.
__label__2@  In this approach, 50–60 cm of bowel is isolated.
__label__1@  A Vaseline gauze is used to cover the stoma which is left uncatheterized.
__label__2@  The instruments in arms 1 and 3 may be replaced with robotic needle drivers at this time, and whichever suture the surgeon prefers may be passed through the accessory trocar.

__label__1@  The lateral prostatic fascia and neurovascular bundle are then dissected away from the prostate in an interfascial plane.
__label__2@  Incisional pain should be significantly less than in an open operation, so the use of narcotics should be limited. 
__label__1@  A urostomy appliance is placed over the stoma.
__label__2@  Laterality was initially determined by the anatomic predominance of the anterior mediastinal mass. 
__label__1@  Trocar 2 is for the left hand and should be a bipolar/retracting instrument.
__label__1@  The curved trocars are removed under direct vision.
__label__1@  This mobilization should be started in the posterior plane and then developed laterally for a small distance.
__label__1@  The tumor is then excised with a combination of sharp dissection with the cold scissors and blunt dissection and countertraction with the suction-irrigator.
__label__1@  For the abdominal approach, the operating table is turned 90 and brought into position to allow easy entry of the robotic cart and arms directly over the midline of the patient.

__label__1@  Using monopolar shears, the ascending colon is then mobilized by continuing the peritoneal incision lateral to the colon along the white line of Toldt.
__label__1@  If SLN detection is planned, the cervical injection of dye should be done prior to placement of a uterine manipulator.
__label__2@  Postoperatively, tachycardia can be expected secondary to autonomic dysreflexia and sympathetic discharge from the RPLND and should not be confused with hypovolemia.
__label__2@  Visualization of the duodenum usually indicates a sufficient mobilization.
__label__1@  This is carried down following the shape of the pelvis to the level of the pubic symphysis.
__label__2@  The limb may be secured to the retroperitoneum to simplify the anastomosis and stent placement.
__label__2@  This would be analogous to tenting the uterus up out of an open abdomen during laparotomybased hysterectomy.
__label__1@  If an extra capsular mass was present without a preoperative pathologic diagnosis, a biopsy sample was obtained.
__label__1@  If a nerve-sparing procedure is not planned, the neurovascular bundle is divided using the laparoscopic stapler, and the endopelvic fascia is opened as described above.
__label__2@  Visualization is important given the lack of tactile cues. 
__label__1@  The thymic venous tributaries that drain the innominate vein are identified, clipped, and divided.
__label__1@  For the initial division, a tan load for the Tri-Staple ™ (Covidien; Dublin, Ireland) is recommended, or a 2.5-mm vascular load.
__label__1@  For left-sided cases, the ureter and gonadal vessels, both invested in Gerota's fascia, are retracted using the fourth arm instrument.

__label__1@  An equal defect is created in the bowel in the appropriate location.
__label__1@  The left ureter is not passed under the sigmoid colon, but is anastomosed to the left limb, and the right ureter is anastomosed to the right limb (Fig.14.34).
__label__1@  The arms should be tucked and the patient appropriately secured.
__label__2@  Variations in the robot placement depend on the robotic model, operating room setup, and surgeon preference.

__label__2@  The robot platform is a “tool” used to help facilitate this procedure.
__label__2@  For an LLND, lymph nodes can be sent in four separate packets: right and left external iliac and right and left obturator; In an ELND technique, 11 packets are sent: right and left common iliac, right and left external iliac, right and left internal iliac, right and left obturator, right and left node of Cloquet, and anterior bladder fat.;The greater number of packets allows for a more thorough pathologic evaluation.
__label__1@  The radial arterial and central venous pressures were monitored to ensure adequate hemodynamics during progressive CO2 insufflation.
__label__1@  To remove the gallbladder, an endoscopic retrieval bag is inserted through any trocar (upsized if needed), and the specimen is collected.

__label__1@  The horizontal fissure is finally separated.
__label__1@  The robot will be docked along the patient’s left side; it can come straight in from the left or be angled at 45 degrees, coming in from the patient’s left leg.
__label__1@  Conversion to laparotomy must be considered if hemostasis cannot beachieved endoscopically.
__label__1@  This dissection is facilitated by the exposure arm grasping the inferoposterior edge of the pylorus.

__label__2@  The dissection posterior to the prostate is a critical step of RARP, in particular when treating high-volume, bulky tumors or patients who have had previous radiation therapy.
__label__2@  The uretero-enteric anastomoses are then performed in the same way as for ileal conduit urinary diversion, detailed above.
__label__1@  This skeletonization allows easy transection of the IP ligament; it should first be cauterized with a robotic bipolar instrument and then transected using the scissors and monopolar energy.
__label__2@  As in open surgery, the surgeon must utilize all of the robotic arms to help maintain traction and countertraction at all times.
__label__1@  The right gastric artery and vein are ligated and transected as well as the right gastroepiploic artery and vein at the greater curve, preserving the arcade vessels of the proximal part of the stomach.

__label__1@  The assistant secures the suture outside the body with a hemostat.
__label__1@  A cystogram is performed to ensure no leakage before catheter removal.
__label__1@  A wide enterotomy and spatulation on the ureter are necessary to pass the needle driver through the enterotomy in order to grab the stent.
__label__2@  Clinical staging and tumor appearance on MRI may guide the surgeon to perform wider dissection in order to achieve an oncologic resection.

__label__2@  A larger vaginal margin is required in radical hysterectomy.
__label__2@  Take care not to enter the colonic mesentery or injure the colon or the duodenum.
__label__1@  The lateral prostatic fascia is incised over the right anterior prostate, at the level of the puboprostatic ligaments (Fig.14.6).
__label__1@  When extreme colon length is needed, as in a proctectomy, the vein should be divided here, but for a sigmoid resection, the vein usually can be ligated closer to the colon, when dividing the mesentery.
__label__1@  The appendix is removed.
__label__1@  Retrieve the soft tissues around the celiac artery, which contain lymph node station 9.
__label__2@  The left-sided approach, however, is difficult owing to diminished mediastinal working space secondary to the cardiac mass. 
__label__2@  This action also aids in identifying retrogastric adhesions, which must be lysed to completely mobilize the stomach.
__label__1@  Normally, 40 compressions are performed, although one can go up to 50 or 60.

__label__1@  As the trocar is inserted, the obturator is removed and the folded balloon glides into the retroperitoneal space, in a Seldinger type fashion.
__label__2@  Generally these non-barbed sutures are cut to approximately 15 inches, which prevent the excess suture from becoming cumbersome during closing of the vaginal cuff.
__label__2@  The bedside assistant’s use of thoracoscopic suction to maintain a clear surgical field aids in this dissection, as does careful maintenance of hemostasis with the robotic bipolar cautery forceps. 
__label__1@  The vagus nerve is also divided at this level to avoid traction injury to the recurrent laryngeal nerve.

__label__1@  The remaining ports are placed under direct intrathoracic visualization.
__label__2@  Recently, several meta-analyses examining the use of barbed suture for completion of the vesicourethral anastomosis found similar complication and continence rates with reduced operative time.
__label__2@  The permanent cautery hook may speed up the procedure. 
__label__1@  Once the obturator packet is freed distally, the packet can be removed, as the proximal attachments were already divided during the dissection of the fossa of Marseille.
__label__2@  Care is taken to allow a distance of at least 2 cm between the anastomotic and gastrotomy closure staple lines. 
__label__1@  If there is concern the branch clamped has decreased perfusion to normal kidney, the bulldog is unclamped immediately.
__label__1@  It is introduced transorally by the anesthesiologist and passed distally until the tip of the nasogastric tube reaches the stapled end of the esophagus.

__label__1@  Then, an early unclamping is performed.
__label__2@  The most common complications for robotic gastrectomy for gastric cancer are wound infections, intraluminal bleeding, and anastomotic leakage.

__label__2@  For those with tumors in the mid to distal ureter, a pelvic lymphadenectomy (as above) can be performed.
__label__2@  As this is occurring in another quadrant of the abdomen, the surgical field needs to be altered.

__label__2@  The distal marking is made with 2-0 silk stay sutures as detailed in the above description of ileal conduit creation.
__label__1@  After division of the DVC and completion of nerve sparing, the urethra is prepared and divided beyond the apex of the prostate.
__label__1@  The superficial dorsal vein can be controlled with bipolar cautery and the anterior prostate fat cleared off the surface of the prostate because it occasionally harbors lymph nodes.
__label__1@  Following omentectomy, attention is turned to dividing the stomach from its posterior attachments to the pancreas, using either the energy sealant device or sharp dissection.

__label__1@  The remaining robotic instruments are removed, and the robot is undocked.
__label__1@  In the remaining patients, thymectomy was facilitated by right lung deflation and CO2 insufflation to a pressure of 10 to 15 mm Hg.
__label__2@  Two intact donuts and visual inspection confirm a successful anastomosis. 
__label__1@  Alternatively, a selective vagotomy can be performed by transecting all the branches of the anterior and posterior vagus traveling to the esophagus and stomach starting about 7 cm proximal to the esophagogastric junction through the esophageal hiatus and then transecting the trunks of both the anterior and posterior vagus nerves distal to the takeoff of the intestinal branches that travel toward the celiac axis and the hepatic branch that travels with the left hepatic artery in the lesser omentum.
__label__2@  Identifying the “sweet spot” of the robotic camera arm and positioning the arms to allow for maximal arm movement will decrease the need to reposition the robotic arms during the operation.

__label__1@  The proximal end of the conduit is closed using absorbable 3-0 polyglactin sutures in continuous fashion.
__label__1@  A semilunar incision is then created through the conduit.
__label__2@  One will be used for the posterior wall (furthest from the camera), and one will be used for the anterior wall (closest to the camera).
__label__2@  As manipulation of the adrenal tissue is undertaken, early control of venous drainage, especially in cases of pheochromocytoma, is critical to minimize catecholamine release into the systemic circulation.
__label__1@  Dissection should be conducted along the sub-adventitial layer using a combination of sharp and blunt dissection to isolate the vein completely.
__label__1@  The stents are cut short and an ostomy appliance is placed over them.
__label__1@  This can involve a running closure with an absorbable 0 polyglactin suture.
__label__1@  Once the distal ureter is approached, the excess ureter is excised by the assistant.
__label__1@  The resection margins are set about 1 cm distal to the pylorus and the proximal third of the stomach.
__label__2@  The plane posteriorly is developed sharply and bluntly all the way to the apex of the prostate.
__label__2@  For these tumors, haptic feedback is essential, as palpation is often important in determining the proximal and distal extent of tumor and the appropriate resection margin.
__label__1@  The robotic instruments are then removed and the robot is undocked.
__label__1@  This dissection is continued distally to the urethra.
__label__2@  The patient should have some form of immobilization. 
__label__2@  Numerous descriptions of nerve sparing during RARP have been reported in the literature.
__label__1@  Once all ports have been placed, the patient should be rotated to the right and placed in Trendelenburg position.
__label__1@  Then we tape the pannus to the thigh and place reinforcing tape to prevent the tape from coming apart during the case.
__label__2@  At the authors’ institution a RAMIE approach was initiated in 2010 with the primary goals as follows: to maximize patient safety; to allow controlled introduction of robotic technology to already established procedures, with critical, prospective examination of outcomes and adverse events; and if feasible, to develop a standardized procedure potentially portable to other centers and surgeons performing these operations.
__label__1@  The lower pole of the kidney within the Gerota’s fascia can also be identified.
__label__1@  In addition, a Wallace-style ureteral anastomosis is performed on the afferent limb.
__label__2@  A small retrospective study demonstrated a statistically significant decrease in mean total operative time of 75 minutes over a 4-year period during early adoption of the procedure.
__label__1@  We always proceed performing a 3-cm utility incision at the 5th intercostal space anteriorly of the latissimus dorsi.
__label__1@  The remaining 8-mm trocars are inserted as follows: left upper quadrant trocar (at the left midclavicular line, just inferior to the level of the falciform ligament), right upper quadrant trocar (at the right midclavicular line, 5–10-cm below the costal margin), and right upper quadrant trocar (8–10-cm lateral and inferior).
__label__1@  The neurovascular bundle is dropped with a combination of blunt and sharp dissection.
__label__1@  Patients are extubated in the operating room and remain overnight in a step-down unit.
__label__1@  The base of the ileocecal valve is imbricated, using Lembert style 3-0 silk sutures in a seromuscular layer in three locations equally spaced around the ileocecal valve, superiorly, anteriorly, and inferiorly.
__label__1@  Much of this dissection can be done by bluntly sweeping the lymphatic tissue anteriorly and distally, with care taken to cauterize perforating vessels and avoid traction injury to the obturator vessels.
__label__1@  If the Xi ® system is used, we typically use all four arms.
__label__1@  Wide prepping of the abdomen from the nipple line to the suprapubic region is followed by draping in the standard sterile fashion.
__label__1@  The transabdominal stitch is removed from the bowel and pulled through the abdominal wall.
__label__1@  The afferent limb of the neobladder is closed using absorbable 3-0 polyglactin sutures in continuous fashion.
__label__1@  The bladder is then filled with saline to allow for identification of the plane between the bladder and the anterior vaginal wall.
__label__1@  An alternative is to switch arms 1 and 3.
__label__1@  The resistance and the measurements are noted.
__label__2@  The distance between the tips of the monopolar Endo Shears and the end of the gray line is 5.4 cm.
__label__1@  Once the inferior pulmonary vein is visualised, the anterior mediastinal pleura is dissected to expose and identify the middle and upper lobe vein an determine the presence of a normal venous anatomy.
__label__1@  Trocar 3 is the retraction arm and can be placed just to the right of the subxiphoid space.
__label__1@  The robotic-assisted procedure was performed under general anesthesia with selective single-lung ventilation, and radial artery and central venous catheters.
__label__1@  This is performed in a right-to-left manner in order to give orientation to the ureter later during the urinary diversion.
__label__2@  As the left dog-ear is closed, leave 5 cm open to allow passage of the stents.
__label__2@  All patients lose weight postoperatively, but weight loss is rarely dangerous and seldom requires invasive intervention.
__label__1@  Dissection is then carried along the psoas muscle elevating the kidney and perinephric fat.
__label__2@  There can be situations where the specimen is too large to fit through the vaginal canal.
__label__1@  A robotically sewn “ baseball-stitch ” purse-string suture is placed to hold the anvil in place, as well as a second, more superficial robotically sewn purse-string suture as reinforcement.
__label__1@  This should be incised to mobilize the cecum.
__label__1@  In contrast to a laparoscopic approach, all ports are shifted inferiorly towards the iliac crest.
__label__1@  We prefer to use a 3-0 V-Loc suture across the base of the resection to close any collecting system or vascular injuries.
__label__1@  If not, secure the ileum on either side of the previous suture until arm 3 can be removed.
__label__1@  With anterolaterally retraction of the kidney with the 4th arm, the renal hilum will be stretched and facilitate easier exposure of the renal artery posteriorly.
__label__2@  There is no general consensus on the importance of oversewing the cervical stump prior to RASC; case reports, however, appear to suggest that oversewing the cervical stump may reduce complications.
__label__2@  Some surgeons prefer to use Gore-Tex suture to attach the mesh to the vaginal walls and ALL; recent studies, however, have shown similar outcomes with the use of absorbable sutures. 
__label__1@  The robot system is brought in directly cephalad (Si System) to the patient with the center of the robotic cart aligned with the patient’s head or perpendicular to the OR table (Xi System), and the boom is rotated appropriately.
__label__1@  Exposure of the upper and lower vein is always recommended to confirm the presence of a normal vein anatomy.
__label__2@  In robotic single-site cholecystectomy, ICG near-infrared fluorescent cholangiography is especially useful and can be incorporated into the surgeon’s armamentarium. 
__label__1@  The stents and red Robinson catheter are removed one-day before discharge.
__label__1@  Distally, clips or cautery should be used to ligate lymphatic vessels stemming from the leg, for lymphostasis.
__label__1@  A 12.5-g dose of mannitol can be given intravenously prior to hilar clamping.
__label__1@  The dissection of perinephric fat is as minimalist as possible.
__label__1@  Finally, a colpotomy incision can be created either with the monopolar scissor cautery or an instrument suitable to the surgeon.
__label__1@  The lymphatic tissue is then mobilized off of the lateral aspect of the iliac artery and vein.
__label__1@  On the left the splenorenal ligament has to be taken down, exposing the lateral limit of the pancreas and splenic vessels.
__label__1@  The right side of the Indiana pouch is then rotated counterclockwise 90 °.
__label__1@  The renal artery is clamped alone as opposed to the arteryvein clamped en bloc because it is well established that applying artery-only clamping, especially in cases with prolonged ischemia time, lessened ischemic renal damage during LPN.
__label__1@  The bladder and prostate are then placed in a specimen retrieval bag to be removed at the time of urinary diversion (Fig.14.8).
__label__1@  A 2-0 V-Loc suture then follows in a continuous horizontal mattress fashion to reapproximate the renal parenchyma and complete the renorrhaphy.
__label__1@  The cardinal ligament is transected until this boundary is identified.
__label__2@  The renal vein is usually anterior to the artery and renal pelvis, although vascular variations may exist
__label__1@  A piece of precut umbilical tape 20-cm long is placed into the abdomen.
__label__2@  Postoperatively, neither nasojejunal drainage nor artificial nutrition is necessary. 
__label__1@  The conduit is then reapproximated to the specimen with heavy suture to allow for properly oriented entry through the hiatus into the chest during the thoracoscopic phase of the operation.
__label__1@  Careful measurements of the vagina, including the total vaginal length and location of the urethrovesical junction, must be taken at the outset of the procedure in order to determine the extent of the dissection.
__label__2@  This plane should be developed laterally to the abdominal sidewall, inferiorly to the start of the mesorectum, and superiorly to the border of the pancreas. 
__label__1@  For reconstruction of gastrointestinal continuity, the Billroth II or the Roux-en-Y procedure is used.
__label__2@  When using the da Vinci Xi, the trocars should be arranged in a more linear fashion and need to be only 8 cm apart.
__label__1@  Adjust the table if necessary to achieve the best view.
__label__1@  Halfway through the anastomosis, a single-J urinary diversion stent is placed across the anastomosis and brought out through a stab incision in the right anterior aspect of the pouch.
__label__2@  Sigmoid and left colectomies are often lumped into rectal surgery papers, and several large national database studies mix right, left, and sigmoid colectomies together. 
__label__1@  Using the existing port configuration, a hand-assist gel port and the Alexis wound retractor are placed in the 7-cm incision used for specimen retrieval, and the abdomen is re-insufflated.
__label__2@  This can help the surgeon better identify the plane between the bladder and the cervix/uterus.
__label__1@  The proximal redundant conduit and gastrotomy are closed with an Endo gastrointestinal stapler.
__label__2@  This move identifies the soft tissue that is encasing the right gastric artery as it is attached to the proper hepatic artery.
__label__1@  At this point, the lymphatic tissue is mobilized off the medial aspect of the external and common iliac vessels.
__label__1@  The bedside assistant can then position himself or herself to the patient’s left, opposite the vision cart.
__label__1@  The IVC can be rolled/retracted by the assistant to expose the retrocaval lymph node packet.
__label__1@  One milliliter of dye is then injected into four locations in the cervical stroma, using a spinal needle.
__label__1@  The bare area superior to the IMA is incised, and the pedicle is isolated and cleaned of the overlying fat.
__label__1@  In general, any oro- or nasogastric tube is removed prior to extubation and the patient is given a clear liquid diet in the recovery room once fully awakened from anesthesia.
__label__2@  Thus, we now favor a right-side approach for all patients.
__label__1@  The patient again should be placed in a low lithotomy position.
__label__1@  The robot is undocked.
__label__2@  Use of a Penrose drain around the esophagus may aid in retraction and exposure, but is often not necessary. 
__label__1@  If an orthotopic continent diversion is planned, the endopelvic fascia should be spared to improve continence outcomes.
__label__2@  If the Xi® system is used, we typically use all four arms.
__label__1@  This is then retracted into the air by the third arm.
__label__1@  The first step of the procedure is the omentectomy, which is accomplished by retracting the greater omentum cephalad, identifying the transverse colon, and dividing the colon from the omentum by entering the avascular plane between the two and proceeding toward the splenic flexure.
__label__1@  Microsurgical bulldog clamps are used to clamp the targeted arterial branches and evaluation of the collateral kidney around the tumor is performed to confirm normal color and turgor.
__label__1@  The second needle is passed in a similar fashion at the same location.
__label__2@  More recently, the Y-pouch neobladder, as described by Sim et al. [6], was applied in the robotic arena.
__label__1@  Retraction using the fourth arm of the obliterated umbilical artery allows blunt dissection between this and the obturator packet.
__label__1@  The parenchymal defect is repaired using 0-Vicryl running sutures.
__label__1@  A 15-cm afferent limb segment is marked in the ileal segment of the neobladder.
__label__1@  The ligament should be taken down, advancing laterally until the colon is completely mobile.
__label__1@  Rather, the stapler is fired across the bowel, including a portion of the mesentery.
__label__2@  Care should be taken to create a watertight anastomosis, with a “no touch” technique on the ureteral mucosa.
__label__2@  In general, some of the many methods described for laparoscopic reconstruction can be adapted to a robotic operation. 
__label__2@  We describe our transperitoneal operative techniques.
__label__1@  Replace the 5-mm assistant trocar and have the bedside assistant grasp the gallbladder fundus and retract superiorly.
__label__2@  First step is the right middle lobe vein isolation.
__label__2@  The needle is ideally held parallel to the plane of the anterior sacrum as soon as the ligament is penetrated in order to avoid deeper structures such as bone or disc. 
__label__2@  Care should be taken to avoid dissection of the peritoneum in the anterior/posterior plane as one can potentially injure the ureter that is attached to the peritoneum.
__label__1@  The bladder is retracted with the fourth arm to the contralateral side and cephalad to expose the angle of dissection.
__label__2@  Between October 2001 and December 2003, 18 consecutive patients with anterior mediastinal disease were referred for diagnosis and treatment. 
__label__2@  Next phase is robotic right middle lobectomy.
__label__2@  The optimum exposure is achieved using the right lateral robotic arm (Cadiere forceps). 
__label__2@  Posteriorly located renal tumors may also be approached via retroperitoneal access with the aid of dissector systems such as SpaceMaker™ (Covidien).
__label__1@  If possible we close the Gerota’s fascia.
__label__2@  The catheter should be mobile prior to stapling, ensuring that the urethra is not ensnared in the stapler.
__label__1@  The vision cart is usually placed at the foot of the operating table.
__label__2@  This can be addressed in four ways.
__label__2@  We believed the robotic-assisted technology was applicable in this case. 
__label__2@  Therefore the delicate nature of this portion of the operation supports minimizing handling of the bundle tissue, avoiding excessive traction on the bundle and cautery in order to prevent thermal injury to the bundle.
__label__2@  Early ambulation on the first postoperative day is routine. 
__label__1@  Single dock the robot and move arm 3 from the left of the robot to the right side.
__label__1@  Once adequately suture ligated, the complex can be divided sharply or with cautery.
__label__2@  The cavernous nerves may be injured by transection, use of the cautery, and excessive traction.
__label__1@  The assistant can then retract the colon inferiorly by grasping an epiploic appendage.
__label__2@  Eleven out of 13 studies reported use of a macroporous monofilament polypropylene mesh in a recent systematic review and meta-analysis.
__label__1@  The vein is then isolated and encircled with a vessel loop.
__label__1@  Using the Cadiere graspers to hold the two most distal stay sutures, a 60-cm articulating Endo-GIA stapler is brought in through the lower assistant port.
__label__2@  Finally, a single-port setup is an option through the umbilicus. 
__label__1@  A Kelly forceps is used to penetrate the fascia and enter the retroperitoneal space.
__label__1@  An arterial line is placed routinely, and single-lung isolation with doublelumen tube intubation is performed routinely during the thoracoscopic phase.
__label__2@  Never use a water-soluble lubricant like KY Jelly or Surgilube.
__label__2@  As a distinguishing feature, Gerota’s fascia appears pale yellow, compared with the brighter yellow color of the mesentery.
__label__1@  The patient is placed in optimum reverse Trendelenburg position (as allowable by the robotic cart), the robotic arms are docked to the ports, and the robotic instruments are placed into the peritoneal cavity under direct vision.
__label__1@  The left arm will be controlled with the right hand and vice versa.
__label__1@  The staple line on the ileal segment of the Indiana pouch is excised.
__label__1@  Using a 0-degree or 30-degree down robotic endoscope, inspect the anatomy and readjust the position of the table appropriately.
__label__2@  Careful attention to positioning with appropriate application of padding must be made to avoid any nerve injury.
__label__2@  Port placement for robotic gastrectomy follows the same principles as port placement for any laparoscopic or robotic procedure. 
__label__2@  A leak of the esophagojejunal anastomosis is the most common major complication following total gastrectomy.
__label__2@  A monopolar and a bipolar instrument are commonly selected and are generally placed in arms 3 and 1, respectively, for a righthanded surgeon.
__label__1@  A 75-cm single-J stent with 20-cm of the noncoiled end removed is placed over a wire, and 2–3-cm of the wire is exposed (enough to take the curl out of the ‘ J’).
__label__2@  This helps the surgeon with dissecting the tissues and avoiding injuries to the ureter, bladder, and other surrounding tissues.
__label__1@  The left arm can be secured at the side or remained out with a Reverse Trendelenburg (10–15 °) with slight left table tilt.
__label__1@  The suprapubic tube and stents are placed to gravity drainage.
__label__1@  The conduit is secured to the fascia at four locations using 0 polyglactin suture through a seromuscular layer.
__label__1@  A 19-Fr round Blake drain is brought through the left pararectus port site and placed along the urethral anastomosis and adjacent to the ureteroileal anastomoses.
__label__1@  With the lateral right grasper, the stent is held close to the anastomosis site.
__label__1@  The needle driver is now used to pinch the stent next to the wire, not including the wire in the grasp, which will allow the assistant to pull the wire while leaving the stent in place.
__label__1@  The round ligament may be transected while opening the paravesical and pararectal spaces or transected prior to development of the vesicouterine space.
__label__2@  Gastric decompression is recommended to increase the operative domain and permit easy manipulation of the stomach during the operation. 
__label__1@  A large clip is then applied on the ureter just proximal to its insertion.
__label__1@  Begin the dissection using the ultrasonic shears in the left dissection arm approximately 6-cm away from the edge of the greater curvature in the omental draping.
__label__2@  The robotic cases were shorter (217 vs. 252 min), and the robot group had minimally but significantly shorter stays and quicker return of bowel function. 
__label__1@  The end-anastomotic stapler is introduced through the mini access incision and carefully placed into the proximal conduit.
__label__2@  A liquid diet is begun in the absence of leak or if an identified leak is small and contained. 
__label__2@  The patient is usually seen 1–2 weeks postoperatively in the outpatient setting and can be followed based on the surgeons’ standard practice.
__label__1@  A 20-French catheter is passed as the anastomosis is almost complete.
__label__1@  The ureter and gonadal vein packet are found inferior to the lower pole and lateral to the ipsilateral great vessel.
__label__2@  The median length of hospital stay is usually 5  days if there are no complications.
__label__2@  The da Vinci Surgical System is the most widely used robotic surgical system for RASC and is used in all RASC surgical technique descriptions.
__label__2@  The suprapubic port site is a popular option because of its good cosmetic results and lower hernia rate. 
__label__1@  The conduit is carefully brought into the chest in proper orientation, with the lesser curve staple line facing laterally.
__label__1@  The specimen is removed, and an Alexis wound retractor is then placed for aid in exposure.
__label__1@  Once hemostasis is ensured, the specimen is extracted after enlarging the camera port or working port incisions.
__label__2@  From our experience, even after the vessels are well cauterized and transected, bleeding can still occur from the vessels.
__label__1@  An additional 6 o’clock polyglactin suture at the neobladder is tied to the tip of the urethral red Robinson catheter, which can act as a handle for the bedside assistant.
__label__1@  An additional 5-cm segment of ileum is then marked, which will be excised to reduce mesenteric tension and to keep the bowel anastomoses farther away from the ureteroileal anastomoses.
__label__2@  We do not routinely send the distal margin for analysis unless the operation is a prophylactic total gastrectomy for hereditary diffuse gastric cancer, in which case frozen section must reveal normal esophageal mucosa at the proximal margin and normal duodenal mucosa at the distal margin. 
__label__2@  There are extra-long robotic trocars that can be used, but generally, we can use the regular-sized robot trocars with this approach.
__label__2@  Commonly used boundaries for extended LND include the common iliac artery and ureteral crossing proximally, the lateral border of the external iliac artery laterally, the bladder medially, the node of Cloquet distally, and the pelvic floor inferiorly.
__label__1@  The staple line of the Roux limb is removed with the energy sealant device, the other end of the circular stapler is placed into the proximal end of the Roux limb, and it is fired.
__label__1@  The patient is prepped and draped, and the 12-mm camera port is placed in the midline using the direct Hassan trocar cutdown technique, with direct visualization of trocar entry into the peritoneal space.
__label__2@  Training in robotic cholecystectomy may be provided through industry-sponsored training, direct observation, and case proctoring. 
__label__2@  However, limitations of space and fixed structures in each operating room are likely to require flexibility and repositioning.
__label__1@  If the tumor margin was not clear, intraoperative ultrasonography was used to better visualize the tumor margin.
__label__1@  We proceeded with thymectomy through a median sternotomy.
__label__1@  Next, the 12-mm assistant and medial robotic port sites are marked.
__label__1@  While pathologists are examining the margins, the Roux-en-Y jejunojejunostomy is created.
__label__2@  The trocars should be at least 10 cm apart and at an approximately 30 angle.
__label__1@  A laparoscopic stapler with a vascular load is brought in through the subcostal assistant port and used to ligate and divide the lateral and posterior pedicles on each side.
__label__1@  The renal resection bed is then treated with the argon beam coagulator to aid with hemostasis.
__label__1@  The mass was gently pealed of the renal sinus fat marking the medial boundary of resection.
__label__2@  The boundaries of limited lymph node dissection (LLND) encompass the tissue in the obturator fossa as well as the area overlying the external iliac vein.
__label__1@  The uterosacral ligament is then transected.
__label__1@  A Veress needle can be inserted to confirm the site before the port is inserted under vision.
__label__2@  An alternative technique used for bladder neck dissection approaches the prostatovesical junction from the anterolateral direction.
__label__1@  Then extend the fascial incision to 2.5-cm.
__label__1@  A new urethral catheter or suprapubic catheter is then inserted into the bladder and inflated.
__label__1@  The robot should come in from the right side, either straight on or from the patient’s right shoulder.
__label__1@  The internal iliac artery is identified with the obliterated umbilical artery retracted medially to mark the medial extent of dissection.
__label__2@  If the tumor is in the splenic flexure or in the proximal descending colon, the resection should take place outside the abdomen instead.
__label__1@  Remove all lights and equipment from the intended patient cart path.
__label__2@  Tewari described a graded nerve- sparing technique that corresponded to postoperative return of sexual function.
__label__1@  First, the entire posterior wall is approximated.
__label__1@  The excised fat is placed in the lower retroperitoneum.
__label__1@  Anterior and posterior vagus nerves should also be identified during this portion of the procedure and divided.
__label__2@  While the importance of nerve sparing to functional outcomes has been well reported, preservation of the bundle should not supersede performing an oncologically sound operation.
__label__1@  A 5-mm robotic port is placed in the third intercostal space in the mid to posterior axillary line, and an 8-mm robotic port is placed in the fifth intercostal space.
__label__1@  The patient is returned to supine position and extubated.
__label__1@  Alternatively, a separate Pfannenstiel incision can be created.
__label__1@  The Foley catheter is then retracted superiorly, exposing the urethral meatus, which should now be visible through the vaginal opening.
__label__1@  The lymphatic tissue is then mobilized in order to skeletonize the external iliac vessels.
__label__2@  Historically, surgeons appeared to prefer the use of sacrocolpopexy to repair large anterior or apical defects.
__label__1@  Visualization of these vessels is greatly facilitated by the optics on the robotic machine.
__label__2@  The right-sided midclavicular robotic port site should be at the level of the first portion of the duodenum.
__label__1@  Once the bladder is completely mobile, it is placed in a specimen retrieval bag.
__label__1@  After removing the camera, the silicone port, the remaining trocars, and the gallbladder specimen are removed.
__label__2@  The medial limit of dissection is contiguous with the bladder.
__label__1@  At this point, the robot might need to be fully redocked.
__label__1@  Patient-controlled analgesia and deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis are provided.
__label__1@  Start water intake, remove Foley catheter, and encourage out of bed.
__label__1@  Once inside the abdomen, the Keith needle is passed through the staple line at the distal end of the ileal loop.
__label__2@  Patients are often counseled about the need for concomitant vaginal repairs, especially when the surgeon aims to limit graft exposure to the vaginal canal and/or distal pelvic floor defects persist after sacrocolpopexy.
__label__2@  The European Association of Urology guidelines recommend a LND if predicted probability is greater than 5%.
__label__2@  The left adrenal vein usually drains into the left renal vein, and the right renal vein enters the posterolateral IVC.
__label__1@  Exposure of the thymic cords is facilitated by the CO2 insufflation, which helps to create the dissection plane into the neck.
__label__1@  To safely find the right angle to slide the stapler around the pulmonary artery and vein we usually encircle pulmonary vessels with a vessel loop, and we prefer to use curved tip articulated vascular reload.
__label__1@  The patient is well secured to the table at the shoulders, hips, and knees.
__label__1@  A uterine manipulator or other instrument in the vagina is used to delineate the anterior fornix.
__label__2@  Though the proximal and distal margins should be sent for frozen section to confirm normal esophageal and duodenal mucosa, the inability to confirm via palpation that the area of resection is grossly normal makes robotic resection of diffuse histology more difficult.
__label__1@  Once the vasa are dissected and mobilized, they can also be used as a handle for the seminal vesicle dissection.
__label__2@  The stay suture is held in arm 3 to keep the ileum pulled into the pelvis, and 20 cm is measured both proximally and distally.
__label__1@  This dissection was previously started along the proper hepatic artery and is now continued along the common hepatic artery toward the celiac axis and the proximal splenic artery.
__label__2@  Next step is about pulmonary artery isolation. 
__label__1@  We do a gallbladder bed dissection.
__label__1@  Start the right-sided greater curvature dissection by repositioning the Cadiere exposure arm and grasping the greater curvature of the stomach at the level of the cut edge of the gastrocolic ligament.
__label__2@  Rather, the stapler is fired across the bowel, including a portion of the mesentery.
__label__1@  Using the Cadiere grasper (robot arm number 3), grasp the soft tissues along the lesser curvature of the stomach to straighten out the LGA perpendicular to the celiac axis.
__label__1@  If performed initially, an incision is made in the peritoneum at the rectovesical pouch a few centimeters above the visualized rectum.
__label__1@  First, the musculofascial plate of the rectourethralis is approximated to the cut edge of Denonvilliers’ fascia in figure-of-eight fashion using 3-0 polyglactin suture.
__label__2@  Once the hepatic flexure is reached, the mobilization is complete.
__label__2@  This is readily identified by the back of the stomach. 
__label__2@  The left liver lobe is assessed after a period of time and is often sacrificed if no vascular compromise to the liver is identified. 
__label__1@  The vascular pedicle is divided with an endovascular stapler introduced through the assistant port.
__label__1@  The uretero-enteric anastomosis is then performed in end-to-side, spatulated fashion using interrupted or continuous 4-0 polyglactin or monofilament absorbable suture.
__label__1@  A 3-0 barbed or Vicryl suture is used to bring the posterior musculofascial plate behind the urethra to the cut edge of the Denonvilliers fascia.
__label__1@  The genitofemoral nerve is identified and preserved.
__label__2@  This port is for use with the ultrasonic shears (Harmonic Scalpel; Ethicon Inc, Somerville, NJ), which have a shorter operative length than most other instruments used with the current robotic system. 
__label__1@  For this, an incision is made parallel to the psoas muscle 2 cm above the psoas tendon.
__label__1@  The patient may be placed in steep Trendelenburg position until the presacral space and vaginal apex are accessible.
__label__1@  The urethral anastomosis is performed, and 20-cm total bowel is incised along the antimesenteric border.
__label__1@  The assistant passes a small bowel grasper through the upper port.
__label__1@  The mediastinal pleura is then retracted posteriorly with Cadiere forceps (arm 3).
__label__2@  If evaluating SLNs, it is important to remember that most are found in the internal or external iliac nodal basin, with the majority lying in the interiliac region.
__label__1@  In particular, the patient-side cart is positioned so that the camera arm is within the far outer part of the' sweet spot'.
__label__1@  Upper endoscopy is performed before positioning, to assess the position of the tumor and the extent of gastric cardia and fundus involvement, if any.
__label__1@  Dissection is begun anteriorly through the bladder neck using cautery with a transverse incision that is deepened along the junction between bladder and prostate until the catheter is reached.
__label__1@  The levator muscles are bluntly dissected away from the prostate.
__label__2@  If the small bowel mesentery is pliable, a rosebud stoma can be created, but if the small bowel mesentery is not pliable, a modified Turnbull stoma should be created.
__label__1@  Liver transplantation then followed its usual course with either a classical caval replacement technique (UZL, as described above) with the routine use of veno-venous bypass or a piggyback technique (IKEM) without the use of a temporary portocaval shunt.
__label__2@  The Xi system is less dependent on the physical position of the robot and does not require the center column to be in alignment with the camera port.
__label__1@  The conduit is carefully advanced into the chest and positioned, and the stapler spike is brought out along the greater curve in close apposition to the gastroepiploic arcade.
__label__2@  It should be noted that no opening in the neobladder for the urethral anastomosis is made until after the robot is redocked so that we can choose an optimal location on the pouch for the anastomosis based on the exposure.
__label__1@  Primary median sternotomy was performed under general anesthesia with single-lumen endotracheal ventilation.
__label__1@  After confirming the absence of distant disease, the robotic surgical cart is aligned with the operating table and brought in to be docked over the patient.
__label__1@  The posterior mediastinal pleura is divided.
__label__1@  The retro-aortic and para-aortic lymph node packets are then dissected lateral to the IMA toward the left ureter, crossing over the left common iliac artery.
__label__1@  Deep suture placement was avoided to prevent devascularization of the kidney.
__label__2@  This device has an anvil attached to a nasogastric tube. 
__label__2@  This starting point often can be confirmed by following the course of the vas deferens as it courses behind the peritoneum.
__label__1@  Grasp the gallbladder with a laparoscopic grasper through the 5-mm assistant trocar, and check for mobility and whether an adequate anatomic view has been achieved.
__label__1@  The 3D magnified view and precise dissection allow the surgeon to perform adhesiolysis even in the remote area of the chest.
__label__2@  This is noted as the proximal extent of dissection; In thinner patients this may be visible through the peritoneum, but in others it may require incising the peritoneum to identify this landmark.
__label__1@  A 2-0 silk suture is placed on the terminal ileum.
__label__1@  The space is initially entered by incising the peritoneum above the dome of the bladder and lateral to the medial umbilical ligaments.
__label__2@  This point is used as a reference marker for the hiatus, the most cephalad of the abdominal phase, which all instrumentation must be able to reach. 
__label__1@  Control of the renal vein is suggested when approaching hilar tumors, with the aim of reducing bleeding, thus allowing for a bloodless field.
__label__1@  Once the IP ligament is completely transected, the proximal IP ligament stump can easily retract.
__label__1@  The bladder and prostate are retracted to the left and posteriorly.
__label__2@  The da Vinci Si and Xi are equipped with Firefly™ Fluorescence Imaging, which allows the use of indocyanine green.
__label__2@  The future of robotic surgery is promising since multiple new instruments will soon be available to make safer and simpler procedures because as reported by Leonardo da Vinci: “Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication.”
__label__2@  A systematic approach and exposure of key anatomic landmarks are the hallmarks of a safe and adequate lymph node dissection.
__label__1@  We routinely apply hemostatic agents (Evicel ® and Surgicel ®) into the interaortocaval and para-aortic regions.
__label__1@  Similarly with the Xi ® system, we utilize two grasping forceps or Maryland bipolar forceps attached to arms 1 and 2.
__label__1@  Advance to clear liquid diet.
__label__1@  Following the exploration of the whole abdominal cavity for metastatic disease in case of gastric cancer, the gastric lesion should be located.
__label__1@  The bowel loops are paired, and enterotomies are made in the terminal ileum and transverse colon.
__label__1@  The surgeon console is usually positioned to the patient’s left side, with a direct line of vision to the bedside assistant.
__label__1@  Carefully remove the retractor and clamp without withdrawing the port.
__label__1@  Do not finish the left-sided closure until stents have been passed (Fig.14.30).
__label__2@  Postoperative antibiotics are not necessary, but thrombosis prophylaxis should be continued.
__label__1@  All ports should be placed with at least 7-cm space between them.
__label__2@  The main differencesbetween a robotic and abdominal approach, however, involve how the tissues are dissected and blood vessels ligated.
__label__1@  A 3-0 plain gut purse-string suture is used to secure the stents at the afferent limb.
__label__2@  The procedure of radical distal subtotal gastrectomy involving the en bloc dissection of the N2-level lymph nodes as described by the Japanese Gastric Cancer Association can be performed using a directional method with major named vessels as key landmarks of lymph node stations. 
__label__2@  Robotic resections have a longer operative time than either laparoscopic or open resections. 
__label__1@  The corner of each staple line is incised and removed, leaving an approximate 1-cm enterotomy.
__label__1@  In case of inadequate exposure, this incision should be extended with an upper midline extension (reverse T laparotomy).
__label__2@  Morbidly obese patients often require the most significant amount of Trendelenburg position as possible to keep the bowels away from the pelvis, so the pannus/abdomen can often shift or move toward the chest.
__label__2@  The robot took significantly longer (158 vs. 118 min) and cost more to perform ($15,000 vs. $12,000).
__label__2@  Just as with laparoscopic surgery, intraabdominal adhesions can prevent safe visualization of important structures and therefore the technical performance of the operation.
__label__1@  Three to four trocars are used for Si ® multiport cholecystectomy.
__label__2@  Although diverticulitis was once thought to be a contraindication for minimally invasive surgery, such surgery is now commonplace. 
__label__1@  The mesenteric defect is then closed using 3-0 polyglactin suture in continuous fashion.
__label__1@  Dissection is started medially, along the transverse colon.
__label__1@  Attention to port placement will be critical to optimize access to pelvic structures.
__label__1@  We never use any ureteral stent before or after RAPN.
__label__2@  When operating with the da Vinci S system, a colorimetric dye must be used.
__label__1@  All patients presenting with an endoscopyconfirmed and biopsy-confirmed diagnosis of esophageal carcinoma undergo rigorous preoperative evaluation to assess comorbidities and fitness for surgery.
__label__1@  Legs' pressure points are carefully padded with pillows and foam pads.
__label__1@  Placement of a rectal probe can help to delineate the rectosigmoid colon from other pelvic structures such as the vagina, uterus, and/or ovaries.
__label__1@  The specimen is then resected with appropriate margins.
__label__2@  Intuitive Surgical (Sunnyvale, CA) is currently the only provider of surgical robotic systems. 
__label__1@  Divide any remaining posterior attachments to prepare for proximal gastric resection.
__label__2@  Since the intent is to avoid inadvertent injury to the rectum, limited use of cautery to optimize visualization of the perirectal fat plane is prudent.
__label__1@  The tubing is pulled out of the abdomen through the 12-mm port, pulling the anvil down the esophagus.
__label__2@  The term suprapubic is a historical term for this catheter and not at the true suprapubic region.
__label__1@  Opening of the avascular spaces should continue, and this may be done mostly in a blunt fashion.
__label__1@  The medial umbilical ligaments and urachus are divided using cautery proximally along the anterior abdominal wall.
__label__2@  In conclusion, the evidence to date shows that robotic surgery is more expensive than laparoscopic surgery and operative time is increased, especially for right colectomies. 
__label__2@  Patients with a normal clinical exam and normal vital signs are started on sips of clear liquids on their first postoperative day and advanced daily. 
__label__1@  Finally, the stents can be externalized through the abdominal wall.
__label__1@  The incision is deepened through areolar tissue following a plane below the vas deferens and seminal vesicles.
__label__1@  The optimum exposure is achieved using the right lateral robotic arm (Cadiere forceps).
__label__1@  With gentle medial retraction of the obliterated umbilical artery, following its course and insertion into the hypogastric artery can identify the hypogastric lymph node packet.
__label__1@  The suprapubic catheter is hand-irrigated every 4-h.
__label__1@  The balloon is then inflated with 15-mL of sterile water.
__label__1@  A Carter-Thomason device is used to close the 12-mm ports with 0 Vicryl under direct visualization.
__label__1@  Our practice is to commonly use a curved clamp followed by a straight bulldog vascular clamp on the artery alone, placed by the bedside assistant.
__label__1@  An assistant’s trocar may be placed laterally in the left lower quadrant if necessary.
__label__1@  This is carefully dissected off the Gerota’s fascia.
__label__1@  A leak test is performed and the pelvis is irrigated.
__label__1@  In doing this, the vascular supply to the bladder will be exposed and can be ligated using bipolar cautery.
__label__1@  The omentum and attachments are then sequentially divided, travelling laterally until the splenic flexure and the previous dissection are areas reached.
__label__2@  It will be switched to the right of the robot and pointed upward for the splenic flexure. 
__label__1@  The IP ligament may be isolated by opening an avascular space in the posterior broad ligament.
__label__1@  All ports can be removed.
__label__1@  If a nerve-sparing procedure is planned, the pedicles should be stapled up to the tips of the seminal vesicles.
__label__1@  We used the LagiPort, a multi-instrument access port designed especially for single-site LPN.
__label__2@  The patient had a preoperative biopsy-proven thymoma and was treated with median sternotomy.
__label__1@  During dissection of the lower pole, great care was taken to avoid injuring the ureter with the aid of the laparoscopic suction device.
__label__2@  The surgeries were approximately equally mixed between right colectomies and sigmoidectomies. 
__label__1@  For the uterus, a uterine manipulator can be positioned by the assistant to adjust the position of the uterus according to the specific part of the surgery.
__label__1@  Similarly, in case of an endophytic tumor, the margins of the tumor are identified with the flexible ultrasound probe and marked with cautery.
__label__1@  Close the blades of the stapler, and use the graspers to gently pull the mesentery away from the stapler to ensure an antimesenteric staple fire (Fig.14.24).
__label__2@  Patients undergoing prophylactic total gastrectomy to prevent hereditary diffuse gastric cancer associated with a mutation in CHD1 are ideal candidates for a robotic approach.
__label__1@  A laparotomy pad can be placed at the introitus to avoid loss of pneumoperitoneum.
__label__1@  Exposure of the liver was facilitated by bilateral cephalad retraction of the ribcage.
__label__1@  Clamp using an atraumatic clamp just below the lower rim, being sure not to clamp the insufflation barb.
__label__1@  The omentum can then be removed from the transverse colon, allowing visualization of the gastrocolic ligaments.
__label__2@  The robotic four-arm approach is a feasible and reproducible method and appears to be well suited to perform a lung lobectomy safely. 
__label__2@  Typical postoperative care instructions are given. 
__label__2@  Excessive mediastinal dissection should be minimized at this time to avoid entry into the pleural spaces, which may cause hemodynamic compromise and loss of intraperitoneal CO2 insufflation.
__label__1@  The duodenum is divided with the stapler device.
__label__1@  The remaining ileum for the neobladder is then detubularized using cautery along the antimesenteric edge.
__label__1@  Follow the dissection that was performed along the anterior GDA until the proper hepatic artery (PHA) is identified.
__label__1@  The left ureter is transposed to the right abdomen through the sigmoid mesenteric window.
__label__2@  Care must be taken to ensure the needle and suture pass through the ALL, and not deeper. 
__label__2@  Described here are the setups for a da Vinci Si® and Xi® system. 
__label__1@  The posterior wall of the neobladder can be performed in a running, single-layer fashion with a self-retaining barbed suture, 2-0 or 3-0, which is run from the urethra to the afferent limb (Fig.14.28).
__label__1@  If SLN assessment is also being done, the lymphadenectomy should be performed first.
__label__2@  The use of cautery and clips may decrease the risk of lymphatic leak. 
__label__1@  The incision is then started at the desired point on the vagina using monopolar cautery and extended circumferentially.
__label__1@  The ureter is manipulated only using the previously placed clip and suture, or the excess ureter.
__label__1@  The ileal conduit is tensioned using the transabdominal stitch to pull the bowel straight
__label__1@  The GIA stapler is then used to staple and divide the ileum at this location.
__label__1@  Once these details are confirmed and the decision to proceed with robotic resection is made, the patient is placed in steep reverse Trendelenburg of approximately 45 °, and the robot is docked.
__label__2@  These include untreated coagulopathy, a lack of equipment, a lack of surgeon expertise, dense upper abdominal adhesions, advanced cirrhosis or liver failure, and known or suspected gallbladder cancer.
__label__1@  The sigmoid colon and its mesentery are then dissected medially.
__label__2@  Recently, a locking, barbed, suture was introduced and facilitates vaginal cuff closure without having to perform knot-tying.
__label__2@  The introduction of robotic-assisted technologies in the late 1990s provided an improvement in visualization and surgical dexterity over thoracoscopy. 
__label__1@  The urethral-ileal anastomosis is then performed in a van Velthoven fashion, with either a barbed suture or two 4-0 Monocryl sutures that have been tied together (Fig.14.27).
__label__1@  For the gastrojejunostomy, an omega loop or a Roux-en-Y reconstruction is used.
__label__2@  Figure 20.9 illustrates the steps in a side-to-side, completely stapled loop gastrojejunostomy. 
__label__1@  The esophagus is divided above the azygos vein, and the nasogastric tube is withdrawn proximally into the remaining proximal esophagus under direct vision.
__label__2@  Early high anterior release of the neurovascular bundles is another way to prospectively identify the prostate border.
__label__1@  The renal hilum and the resection bed are then carefully inspected for any residual bleeding Regular diet is offered in the evening of the surgery and patients are encouraged to walk out of bed within hours of surgery.
__label__1@  To begin, having a camera small enough to rotate among trocars as they are placed is necessary in order to gain different perspectives of adhesions and how they affect the conduct of the procedure.
__label__2@  There are several smoke evacuation devices available that can be used to help maintain excellent visualization throughout this process.
__label__1@  The camera is placed supraumbilically.
__label__2@  Issues precluding RASC include contraindication to pneumoperitoneum, intolerance of steep Trendelenburg positioning, and difficult laparoscopic access among others.
__label__1@  Each vessel was controlled with hem-o-lock clips.
__label__2@  In some cases, selective vascular clamping or even off- clamp excisions may provide sufficient visualization to allow complete tumor resection.
__label__1@  All lymphatic channels proximally should be sealed with either clips or cautery.
__label__1@  The drain is removed when the output is less than 400-mL/24h.
__label__1@  Care should be taken to ligate the superficial dorsal venous complex with bipolar cautery prior to its division.
__label__1@  The puboprostatic ligaments are divided sharply.
__label__1@  A 12-mmHg pneumoperitoneum is created and a 12-mm camera port is placed at the mid-clavicular-line at the level of the umbilicus.
__label__1@  The specimen is retracted laterally and superiorly with the atraumatic robotic grasper, and the deep dissection along the contralateral pleura and left mainstem bronchus is completed.
__label__1@  The peeled down peritoneum is closed either by taking it into the sutures that close the laparotomy or by closing the L-shaped incision separately.
__label__1@  The bladder is then lifted superiorly off of the anterior vagina.
__label__1@  This process continued until the mass was completely excised.
__label__1@  This step is made easier by mobilizing as much colon as possible and dividing the mesentery while in the body.
__label__1@  A 6-cm Pfannenstiel incision is made and a wound protector placed.
__label__1@  Align the patient cart with the anatomy or according to the robot system prompts, and position the camera arm appropriately.
__label__1@  These ends are retracted into the air, and the robotic stapler is fired below, making sure that each corner has been appropriately resected and stapled closed.
__label__1@  The patient was positioned supine on a beanbag with either the right (13 patients) or left (2 patients) chest elevated 30 degrees, with the ipsilateral shoulder retracted and depressed, the arm internally rotated and elbow flexed at the patient's side.
__label__1@  Attach the insufflation tubing to the insufflation port with a three-way stopcock and insufflate to 12–15-mm-Hg.
__label__2@  Gastric cancer is rare in Western centers, so total gastrectomy, regardless of surgical approach, is a relatively infrequent procedure.
__label__1@  At the end of the surgery, the fat pad was placed to cover all areas coated with fibrin sealant, and the bulldog clamp was detached.
__label__1@  The catheter can then be deflated and retracted anteriorly using the fourth robotic arm or the assistant.
__label__1@  Robotic total gastrectomy requires the patient to be placed in steep reverse Trendelenburg position of at least 45 °, so foot boards are commonly used to additionally secure the patient.
__label__2@  Next step is about right lower lobe bronchus. 
__label__1@  An extensive examination of the pleura allows a better visualization of the subcarinal area.
__label__1@  After ensuring hemostasis, the vascular clamps are then removed.
__label__1@  An avascular plane is further developed between the anterior Gerota's fascia and the mesenteric fat of the reflected colon.
__label__1@  Renorrhaphy is performed in two layers using a modified " sliding-clip " technique with V-lok barbed sutures and Hem-o-lok clips.
__label__2@  This completes the dissection of lymph node station 
__label__1@  A sucker can be passed into the lumen for traction to ease the incision.
__label__2@  This allows the needle driver to pass uninhibited through the lumen of the bowel (Fig. 14.26).
__label__2@  The largest hindrance to performing these surgeries totally robotically is the splenic flexure takedown. 
__label__1@  Halfway through the anastomosis, a single-J urinary diversion stent is placed across the anastomosis and brought out the distal end of the conduit.
__label__1@  After the prostate is removed and the specimen bagged, the bladder must be sutured down to the urethra in order to allow for normal micturition.
__label__1@  The patient's arms can either be tucked or positioned on arm boards, with appropriate attention paid to padding the elbows, hands, and other pressure points.
__label__2@  Care is taken to ensure that the Foley catheter and urethra are not caught in the staple line by moving the catheter in and out of the urethra freely after the stapler is clamped.
__label__1@  After renorrhaphy is completed, the clamps are removed and hemostasis is achieved.
__label__1@  Complete thymectomy was then performed in 14 out of the 15 patients.
__label__1@  The arterial clamping is performed a bulldog clamp placed by the assistant.
__label__1@  The sigmoid colon is retracted anteriorly so that the plane between the sigmoid mesentery and the para- aortic lymph node tissue can be identified and incised.
__label__1@  After the patient is placed under general endotracheal anesthesia with two large-bore peripheral intravenous accesses and an arterial line for constant blood pressure monitoring, the patient’s arms are tucked to the sides.
__label__1@  An intraperitoneal drain is placed via a robotic port and secured with a 2-0 silk suture.
__label__1@  The pulmonary artery is encircled with a vessel loop and divided with at 30-mm vascular stapler that is always introduced from the utility incision.
__label__1@  Efficacy of the clamping is evaluated by the discoloration of the parenchyma.
__label__1@  The peritoneal incision is then carried alongside the lateral border of the external iliac artery, keeping the vas deferens tented up anteriorly.
__label__1@  Using the umbilical tape, an additional 20-cm proximally on the ileum is measured out, and here two 3-0 Vicryl stay sutures are thrown, 1-cm apart (Fig.14.22).
__label__1@  Maximizing the pressure of insufflation helps create space and facilitates visualization throughout the procedure.
__label__1@  This dissection can be performed without cautery with the aid of clips to prevent thermal injury to adjacent structures.
__label__2@  Although magnified visualization is superb with RARP, bladder neck dissection can present challenges in that tactile feedback commonly used to identify the prostatovesical junction during open RP is lacking robotically.
__label__1@  The mesentery must be split at this level, to allow it to reach outside the body.
__label__1@  The sigmoid colon should be mobilized nearly to the splenic flexure to allow for adequate lymph node dissection and to create a large window under the inferior mesenteric artery to avoid kinking the left ureter as it crosses under the sigmoid mesentery.
__label__2@  Studies cite a wide range of surgical approaches, with an equally variable quality in the reporting of technique and outcomes, including complications.
__label__1@  Once pneumoperitoneum is established, trocar placement is verified, and instrument arms are connected, the instruments are chosen.
__label__2@  Similarly, the role of lymphadenectomy in the management of upper tract urothelial carcinoma is predicated by the location of the tumor.
__label__1@  The catheter is placed into the Indiana pouch in a Stamm fashion using two rows of purse string 2-0 polyglactin sutures.
__label__2@  The mean operative time was 96 minutes (range 62 to 132 minutes), while the mean robotic time was 48 minutes (range 22 to 76 minutes). 
__label__1@  The vesicourethral anastomosis is then performed.
__label__2@  Consistently, laparoscopic total gastrectomy, when compared with open total gastrectomy, is associated with decreased blood loss, less postoperative pain, faster return of bowel function, shorter hospital stay, lower postoperative morbidity, and longer operative times. 
__label__1@  A laparoscopic Kittner through the lateral robotic port can be used to gently sweep away peritoneum, if more space is needed.
__label__1@  A uterine manipulator is placed along with a Foley catheter to gravity after the patient is sterilely prepped.
__label__1@  The sutures on the two ureters are secured with a grasper that is in the right iliac port.
__label__1@  SLNs are identified and excised.
__label__1@  Lymph node dissection, if indicated, can also be accomplished using this instrument.
__label__1@  A 3-0 polyglactin suture has been placed at the 6 o’clock position of the urethra at the time of urethral division.
__label__1@  Vessels may be cauterized with bipolar energy when avascular portions of the ALL cannot be readily identified.
__label__1@  Prior to hilar clamping, the planned margin of excision is marked on the surface of the renal capsule using cautery.
__label__1@  The sympathetic branches previously identified are preserved as dissection is performed in the interaortocaval location.
__label__1@  The specimen is resected at this point, and the circular stapler anvil is secured to the bowel with a purse-string stitch.
__label__2@  In patients with tumors in the renal pelvis or proximal ureter, a modified retroperitoneal lymphadenectomy (as found above) can be performed contingent on laterality.
__label__2@  Complete bilateral extended pelvic lymph node dissection (EPLND) can be seen in Figs. 15.2 and 15.3. 
__label__1@  The crossing staple lines and the base of the anastomosis are reinforced with interrupted 3-0 silk sutures.
__label__1@  A ruler may be used to determine exposed vaginal length.
__label__1@  The posterior wall of the stomach is grasped and retracted toward the patient’s left shoulder, and the omentectomy is completed by proceeding toward the hepatic flexure.
__label__1@  The crossing staple lines and base of the anastomosis are reinforced with interrupted 3-0 silk sutures.
__label__1@  The lung is retracted posteriorly with the Cadiere forceps (arm 3) to expose this vessel and the anterior mediastinal pleura over the vein is opened.
__label__2@  Care must also be taken to avoid the common iliac vessels.
__label__1@  For a modified Turnbull stoma, a segment of conduit several centimeters proximal to the distal end is brought through the incision.
__label__1@  The orifice of the open esophagus is gently retracted and held open with the aid of the atraumatic robotic grasper by the bedside assistant.
__label__2@  Initially described by Rocco [19], the posterior musculofascial reconstruction helps to reduce tension of the anastomosis and may aid in early recovery of continence.
__label__2@  One patient had postoperative paroxysmal atrial fibrillation that returned to sinus rhythm before discharge. 
__label__2@  Prior cesarean section and intestinal and/or gynecologic surgery predispose the patient to the development of adhesions that may limit access to the pelvis.
__label__1@  Additional cortical reapproximation sutures can be placed if necessary.
__label__1@  The ureter should then be mobilized distally down to its insertion in the posterior aspect of the bladder.
__label__1@  Do not fully divide the ureter; leave a small amount of ureter attached for a handle.
__label__2@  A descending colon tumor usually will require a full mobilization to obtain clean margins and provide a tension-free anastomosis. 
__label__1@  A 12–15-mm length incision for the camera port is made above the iliac crest just lateral to the triangle of Petit.
__label__1@  The spike and anvil are married, and the anastomosis is created.
__label__2@  Frequently-used sutures include barbed suture, which can rapidly close the cuff in a running fashion, as no knots are required.
__label__2@  For safe positioning of larger women, bed extenders or arm sleds may be required.
__label__1@  We prefer to divide the anterior part of the oblique fissure between the right lower lobe and the middle lobe so to achieve a better exposure of the pulmonary artery in the fissure.
__label__2@  Based on growing evidence of its benefits regarding the perioperative and oncological outcome, a larger number of thoracic surgeons have progressively embraced this approach for the treatment of early stage non-small cell lung cancer. 
__label__1@  The entire mesentery can be divided up to the resection site and viability tested with the Firefly ™ technology if desired.
__label__1@  The gastrohepatic attachments are now divided using the energy sealant device in arm 1.
__label__1@  The perirectal fat is identified, and the incision in Denonvilliers’ fascia is carried across the midline just anterior to the rectum.
__label__1@  The distal resection margin is then identified, and the vessel sealer is used to clean off the entire mesentery.
__label__1@  The vessel sealer is also used to divide the remainders of the broad and cardinal ligaments to the level of the cervix (Fig.14.9).
__label__2@  The initial or fixed cost for the platform ranges from $1 million to $2.5 million per unit. 
__label__1@  Excision begins following the clamping of the renal hilum.
__label__1@  When stapling, an Endo GIA stapler (Medtronic-Covidien, Minneapolis, MN) is brought through the lateral assistant port and articulated to straddle the grooves along either side of the DVC.
__label__1@  The obturator vessels and nerve are preserved with hemostatic control of the surrounding lymphatic tissue.

__label__1@  The inferior ligament is divided to the level of the inferior pulmonary vein.
__label__1@  Using the 5-mm atraumatic robotic grasper, the lower lobe of the lung is retracted superiorlaterally.
__label__2@  Morbid obesity is becoming more prevalent in the USA, and these patients can present unique challenges during robotic surgery.
__label__1@  Laparoscopic traction to separate the prostate and bladder tissue is provided by the assistant.
__label__2@  The most common variation is multiple renal arteries, occurring in up to 25–30% of patients [13, 14]
__label__1@  After inspection of the pleural surface, we proceed to divide the pulmonary ligament.
__label__2@  Special precautions should be taken with obese patients, as they tend to move more during surgery. 
__label__1@  For small lesions, it is vital that the tumor is marked preoperatively with tattooing via colonoscope.
__label__1@  A diagnostic laparoscopy can be performed to start.
__label__1@  The redundant mesh at the level of the promontory is removed in an elliptical fashion.
__label__2@  Case reports have indicated that sutures placed into the disc can lead to discitis and additional surgery. 
__label__1@  Grasp the soft tissues on the edge of the greater curvature of the stomach about 8-cm proximal to the pylorus using the Cadiere forceps and pulling superiorly and slightly anteriorly.
__label__1@  A second stapler load is passed into the bowel lumen to create a larger communication between the two bowel segments.
__label__1@  Once the correct pleural plane is identified, we usually deliver a combination of blunt and sharp dissection.
__label__1@  It is important to remeasure distances from the supraxiphoid reference point, as insufflation of the abdomen can result in differences from the initial measurement of 2 to 6 centimeters, depending on the abdominal girth of the patient.
__label__2@  Once ambulatory, a voiding trial is typically instituted due to the high likelihood of concomitant repairs and/or anti-incontinence surgery. 
__label__1@  The previously placed 3-0 polyglactin 6 o’clock posterior urethral suture is then placed in its corresponding location in the urethral aperture and is tied down.
__label__2@  Do not fully divide the ureter; leave a small amount of ureter attached for a handle.
__label__1@  The mucosal edges are then everted using 4-0 chromic sutures in four quadrants of the enterotomy.
__label__2@  Care must be taken to avoid injury to the infundibulopelvic ligament and/or the ureter.
__label__2@  The most frequent indication for cholecystectomy is symptomatic cholelithiasis, but common indications also include biliary dyskinesia, acute and chronic cholecystitis, and complications related to choledocholithiasis. 
__label__1@  We will typically place the specimen in an appropriate fitting Endo Catch bag and bring the specimen through one of the abdominal port incisions, which was extended to accommodate the specimen.
